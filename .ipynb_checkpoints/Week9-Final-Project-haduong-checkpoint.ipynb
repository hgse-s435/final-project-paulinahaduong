    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have 3784 projects from [Getting Unstuck](https://www.gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu), a 21-day summer online learning experience from July 2018. These are projects that K-12 teachers made in Scratch, and each day they responded to a different prompt. Projects vary in size and scope; participants had varied levels of experience. "

    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Hypothesis one: Learners who wrote more reflections had a deeper/multifaceted learning experience/their reflections supported their learning in meaningful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They participated more in the online community.\n",
    "* Their computational fluency was deeper.\n",
    "* They learned more aobut their own tendencies for \"getting stuck.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "We know from constructionist theories that environments that promote creating, sharing, reflecting, and personalizing can support learners in engaging in deeply meaningful work (Brennan, 2013). Often, the \"reflecting\" part is taken for granted, or seen as less essential when teachers have limited amounts of time. And yet, supporting teachers in becoming increasingly reflective practitioners can support productive growth of their teaching practice (Schön, 1987).\n",
    "\n",
    "In what ways does reflecting help learners learn/help us as researchers understand what learners made? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis two: Learners who tagged each other more often had a deeper learning experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They participated more in the online community.\n",
    "* Their computational fluency was deeper.\n",
    "* They were able to support others (reciprocal tagging?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "From the communities of practice literature (Lave & Wenger, 1991), we know that learners who engage in legitimate peripheral participation in a community of practice can develop meaningfully from novices to experts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Getting Unstuck online community, did learners feel like they were in a community? Or did they operate by themselves, receiving the challenge emails each day and posting their projects? Did they interact with others' projects? How did those interactions support their learning? (See also: Illich, 1970).\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "    * how are you planning to test each hypothesis? What models are you thinking of using?\n",
    "    * what are the best results you can hope for? Is that interesting / relevant for other researchers?\n",
    "    * what are implications of your potential findings for practioners?\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Hypothesis One\n",
    "I'm hoping to test the first hypothesis by doing some descriptive work to get a sense of what's in the data: sentiment analysis, topic modeling. \n",
    "* How many projects have written text accompanying them?\n",
    "* Of those projects, how many include text that counts as \"reflection\"?\n",
    "* Of those reflective projects, what did they talk about?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Two\n",
    "I'm hoping to perhaps build a dataframe that contains rows for each person who used tags, then build out columns/counts for the number of tags that happened? I'll need to sync up the usernames to author ids - must pull from another spreadsheet for that."

    "* Insufficient data in each project! (not enough projects)\n",
    "* Can't get all the data from the API I need (comments, favorites, etc)\n",
    "* How to measure computational fluency? One idea is to look at the Creative Computing Guide and say; teachers teaching with this \"should\" be able to use more than one sprite, more than one costume, and also be able to use loops, initialization, parallelism, and variables...\n",

    "* **title:** Title of the project\n",
    "* **description:** Online, this is labeled \"Notes/Credits\"\n",

    "* **image:** cover image for the project (arbitrary)\n",

    "* **history/modified:** last date modified; doesn't show a history of modifications\n",
    "* **history/shared:** date shared; likely shared after completion, but could be shared as a draft (and that was highly encouraged)\n",

    "* **stats/loves:** number of loves (up to the day data was collected - Aug 2018)\n",

    "* **stats/root:** if remixed from another project, this column is filled with the project id of the root (if there was a string of remixes - see [Remix Tree](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Remix#Remix_Trees)."
