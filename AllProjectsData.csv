The solution was to do more of the calculations manually, storing things like current position in variables (so, not limited to the size of the stage).

design & co (test and (re)design, outsource design)
patent office (protect IP)
general store (obtain new materials)

skate park (hack, tinker)
maker bank (obtain funds for new materials*)
movie theater (develop and share documentation/narrative)
public library (research)
museum of makings (exhibit works)
train station [lower left corner] (pitch/present)

This drawing was loosely based on my hometown. At my game design summer camp week we'll be drawing maps as a starting point for some game backdrops as well.

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I use clone function to produce a series of particle that vibrates with a slight time shift, forming a mechanical wave.
Each clone have private variables that regulates its oscillation.
","
*** How a mechanical wave is formed? ***

Imagine a single particle which start moving up and down with harmonic motion at constant frequency and amplitude. 

The energy of the particle is transferred to the particle next to it with a slight delay, depending on the characteristics of the medium (the distance between the particles divided by the time delay equals the velocity of waves in that medium).

Therefore the second particle starts its harmonic motion at a different time but with the same frequency and amplitude of the first particle.
The motion is then transferred to the third particle and so one.
That's how an elastic wave is created!

Do you see some particle moving horizontally?
Actually they are just keep oscillating up and down...

Last week I've been facilitating a workshop on tinkering with Scratch in the physical world (theme was ""summer sounds""). 
Two of the participants were working on making bubbles and popping them using video sensing. They didn't know how to use clones and their exploration went in a different direction, but I was super excited about their idea and I could't wait to make my own version of it!

If it wasn't 1am, I would keep working on this! There is a lot to play with the wind and physics, but also imagining different scenarios (I wasn't sure if it was underwater, or in a park, or somewhere else?) or any type of stories, I could play with colors and making bubble arts, design many games that involve movement.. and much more!

Anyway, I'm really enjoying making with Scratch! Only 2 projects to unstuck.. and only 2 days to unstick! :) (I feel extremely extrinsically motivated by Steven's sticker!)

I worked through a number of issues with layers, but can't figure out how to place a stick that is moved from the middle of the remaining pile back to it's same location after it is moved to the front. I have to rethink the system of using variables to track the layers.

This might work best abandoning the layers altogether and using some sort of physical controller (makey makey, scratchbit, micro:bit?) and collabroation between one person moving the mouse and another operating the mouse click, press, and release.
","Did you ever play the game pick up sticks? You had to move a stick off a pile without any other stick moving.

I've been working all day on having the user move the top stick off the pile, but I'm running into trouble managing layers. I put it back together but now it delays when you move the seventh stick. Keep trying and I'll come back to it later to try to fix it.

251,17,238489203,Dance with letters,"Today's prompt was to make a project using some logical operators ""and, or, not"" to reveal a secret. The prompt was too wide and all it came in my mind were logic puzzles, but I wanted to do something more artistic.

The inspiration came from a video that I watched today about an installation at Artechouse, where people were immersed in a sea of letters and could interact with them by moving their bodies.

I made a first version pretty quickly but then I realized that I wasn't using the logical operators and I needed a secret to reveal. I got stuck, so I went for a walk. When I came back I had the idea of using the letters to reveal a word. The project got much more complicated but I learned more about clones and I'm pretty satisfied with the final result.

PS: I've just realized that the prompt for day 19 is about clones! Now I have to make a different one! :)","Click the green flag, make sure your webcam is on and... dance until you find the ""secret"" message!

To fully enjoy this project, get far from the screen and use all of your body to move the letters around.","Today's prompt was to make a project using some logical operators ""and, or, not"" to reveal a secret. The prompt was too wide and all it came in my mind were logic puzzles, but I wanted to do something more artistic.

The inspiration came from a video that I watched today about an installation at Artechouse, where people were immersed in a sea of letters and could interact with them by moving their bodies.

I made a first version pretty quickly but then I realized that I wasn't using the logical operators and I needed a secret to reveal. I got stuck, so I went for a walk. When I came back I had the idea of using the letters to reveal a word. The project got much more complicated but I learned more about clones and I'm pretty satisfied with the final result.

Enjoy!

AHHHHH - This was my first time exploring strings and lists!
^---- that's a very excited ahhhh!

At first I wasn't even sure what the string blocks might be used for. I started off by looking at the Scratch wiki (https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/String) to see what they even did. (thanks @paulinah)! Then I thought that I would create something that generated randomized text. 

The most exciting part of creating this came as I was thinking of questions to ask. As I plugged in Ask "" "" and wait, and ""add answer to list"" at least 15 times, and saw my code grow longer and longer, I wondered how I could randomize the questions so that they might appear in another order (or be repeated, for re-considering other potential responses.)

I felt comfortable enough to play around with creating the cat while also thinking through the challenges in the project I was programming.

So on Day 14, I settled for the ability to enter characters.  

For Day 20, I added support for the Delete and Enter keys. Again, this was much harder than I thought it would be; it actually makes use of an undocumented Scratch feature, described here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19199766/.  After concluding that there would probably not be an IPO for ""Visual Editor, Improved"", I decided that the only thing left to do before abandoning ship was to add a cool Easter egg. Enjoy!Press the green flag and enter a brief message in the text box. Only lowercase, unaccented characters and space key accepted for now.  The delete key can be used to fix mistakes; press enter when done.

This is derivative of a project I began on day 13 and revised on days 14-15.  I've experimented with: connecting it to makeymakey instruments, bending notes based on the cursor's y position, separating graphix from sound, creating feedback loops through the user's microphone, and with eliminating a need for a user.

In this edition I changed the primary graphic to a spinning ball of thread. Given further time, I'd like to gamify this by creating an additional sprite that one tries to ""catch"" or grab with the fingertip. I think it will be necessary to use the timer and reset blocks to establish whether one has caught the other sprite (to distinguish it from a coincidental on stage passing-by).

An exciting discovery from this project has been the ability to use phantom sprites (e.g., no costume) to shadow other sprites, often by looping a glide instruction e.g. to the x/y of the first sprite. At this phase of iteration I may not be using any phantom sprites in a significant way, but - as we near the conclusion of GU - that's the grist on my mill. Another breakthrough from days 13-15 for me was that I could make these graphix without requiring the user to click or press down on the mouse/trackpad. The gentle fingertip and trackpad activity feels like a new Scratch experience. I'm very grateful for these discoveries! Thanks for the provocations!

Followup: made a remix for PicoBoard so the instrument can be set by a force resistant sensor connected to port D https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/237255829/","Green flag. Move fingertip on touchscreen to change note.

Even though the changes are minimal, the overall look and feel of the project has improved significantly.Move the mouse pointer of the red dots.",26264460,JacobAtInnovEd,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237258995_480x360.png,2018-07-24T14:27:03.000Z,2018-07-24T16:51:57.000Z,2018-07-24T14:47:38.000Z,12,3,2,,,20,3,6,0,0,4,1,53,28,0,['en']

The code is pretty simple, so it doesn't look like I spent hours on it, but I kept trying different things and then tweaking it until I came up with this.Click the green flag to begin",124311,techteech,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237268990_480x360.png,2018-07-24T16:12:08.000Z,2018-07-24T19:59:34.000Z,2018-07-24T19:59:34.000Z,43,11,5,,,20,3,0,0,0,4,1,42,17,0,['en']

Original comments: This project took on a life of its own. I didn't get stuck today. Oh, wait, I spoke too soon. When running my project to check it, sometimes the sprite with the intro words becomes very large & off the screen. (Is this b/c I have both bitmap & vector graphics running at the same time?)

329,19,237272072,water clock,"Getting Unstuck day 20
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I simulated how a mechanical clock works.
The project is not intended to be a precise clock (there are obviously better ways to do it).
I started from a previous project of mine, where I used a pendulum performing a regular motion as the oscillator which gives ""tic"" to the clock. 
In this revised project I use drops of water dripping from a tap at regular time intervals to generate a ""tic"" broadcast message than make the needles move.
Each needle when receive the ""tic"" message rotates of a fixed amount, depending on the period of the drops falling and on the ""role"" of the needle (hours, minutes, seconds). In reality it depends on the gears that connect needles to the mechanism.
The drop block uses ""slide in N seconds"" to generate ""tic"" messages  at regular time intervals.

A regular phenomenon, as the dripping of water from a tap, can be used as source of a regular pulse that make the clock move.
The clock synchronizes with the real time clock when the green flag is pressed (seconds are excluded, so that thin needle always starts at 00).

In this revised project I use drops of water dripping from a tap at regular time intervals to generate a ""tic"" broadcast message than make the needles move.
Each needle when receive the ""tic"" message rotates of a fixed amount, depending on the period of the drops falling and on the ""role"" of the needle (hours, minutes, seconds). In reality it depends on the gears that connect needles to the mechanism.
The drop block uses ""slide in N seconds"" to generate ""tic"" messages  at regular time intervals.

Clock by Dimitry MiroliuboIn this project I simulated how a mechanical clock works.
The project is not intended to be a precise clock (there are obviously better ways to do it).
A regular phenomenon, as the dripping of water from a tap, can be used as source of a regular pulse that make the clock move.
The clock synchronizes with the real time clock when the green flag is pressed (seconds are excluded, so that thin needle always starts at 00).

For this revision I added a slider so that the user can choose the line width of the flower. I also added a random element for the size of the flower.

Notes for the original, Day 2 project.
Inspired by Seymour Papert and Turtle Logo I thought I would use the pen tools and draw things that are a bit like crystal flowers. When doing any Logo I'm always reminded of a photo in the MIT museum of Seymour with one of the big early turtles.

I started with drawing the flowers in a random place but this felt a little strange so I changed it to draw at the mouse pointer to give the user more control. The random block is still there though, if you want to give it a try.

The block that I selected for today's project is the 'username' block from the Sensing category, which provides the username of the person running the project. It's a simple block, but can provide a very personal touch. 

This project is dedicated to the Getting Unstuck community. It has been a joy to participate in Getting Unstuck with you for all 21 days. So many great prompts, projects, and people!

I've been thinking about the differences between starting the creative process when driven by an idea or concept and when driven by an exploration of a new feature/block/function. What does process look like in each of those? What's exciting about each? What does exploring new feature/block/functionality do for our ideas? And what do our ideas do for discovering features/blocks/functionality? 

A way to start exploring those differences seemed to be noticing which is driving a project, and then noticing process along the way.

1s1s: Create a 1s1s project (i.e., a project with only 1 sprite and 1 script).

I was randomly scouring the Scratch Forums and came across a discussion about the ""1s1s"" phenomenon. Here's the discussion thread in question: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/12378/ and here are examples of 1s1s projects: https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=1s1s

As one poster noted, ""Yeah, 1s1s or any of its variations are usually challenges that Scratchers set themselves when making a project to make it more impressive."" I don't know about the ""more impressive"" claim, but there's something interesting about playing with constraints, which is certainly a theme of Getting Unstuck. I've never made (at least not intentionally!) a 1s1s project, so the novelty factor was definitely high!

To be honest, I wasn't at all sure where to begin. I knew I wanted to do a 1s1s, but wasn't sure what types of programs might be best suited to the genre. I love Tetris (so much) so, on a whim, I search for 1s1s Tetris, which led to two results. One of the two results had a version number of 0.7, so I saw an opportunity to extend someone else's neat work, while learning a lot in the process.

In practice, this was kind of a total disaster. (It feels pretty good to end my Getting Unstuck experience with a spectacular failure.) I ended up so confused and frustrated that I turned it into a ""splat"" situation—when blocks land they lose their shape.

What academic subject(s) or domain(s) are/were confusing or difficult for you in school? Make a Scratch project to explore that/those topic(s). Afterwards, reflect on what you knew, and what you now know and do not know. Did your exploration through Scratch change your understanding of what you think you know?

//

I chose to make this particular project for two reasons: as a teacher I find the PicoBoard to be a powerful tool used in conjunction with MakeyMakey. MakeyMakey is more reliably supported across different platforms, but relies on binary variables and boolean expressions. PicoBoard introduces, in a physical computing context, non-binary variables as well. I like to focus on that distinction.

I also chose to build this reusable ""laboratory"" for PicoBoards, which can be easily used (via ports C and D) for comparing the conductivity of different household substances, and which therefore bridges a gap from electronics to chemistry.  As a high school student I was very disenfranchised by math and science classes, and dropped out of STEM entirely in 10th grade. So, this project is my working through areas of ignorance and confusion.

I used a PicoBoard with students last week to measure the conductivity of liquids found in our school fridge. Mustard was the most conductive substance - more conductive than water! That sent us toward a chemist for some explanations. The school's scientist was out, so I texted my wife (an erstwhile scientist), who explained that mustard has a lot of vinegar in it, and vinegar has lots of free hydrogen ions.  I (believe that I) know that vinegar is frequently used, because of its chemical stability, in homemade batteries.  As part of our semi-systematic investigation, this was exciting because it led our computing class to chemistry and then to physics. We started with a device I think I know well, the PicoBoard, but ended in wonderful domains that are beyond my understanding.

The assignment asks students to write a program that draws a brick wall, making blocks to draw bricks and rows of bricks.
I modified it to use Scratch instead and used it as a way to introduce the concept of abstraction through the Make a Block tools. 

My prompt for today keeps the original intent of focusing on abstraction but makes it more open by having you create whatever you want by making blocks. 

For my project itself, I wanted to do something that wasn't drawing, so I made a catch-the-thing-while-avoiding-the-other-thing-type game.

When I was considering ideas for completing the Day 15 project relating to the use of sound (change background depending on volume), I came up with the idea of a roller coaster.  I wanted quieter sounds for images in distance and louder sounds for close-ups.  Started drawing background and roller coaster animation and realized that my priority was making the animation, and that adding in a sound element would have to wait for another time if I was going to finish my challenge that day.
What I like most about my prompt is that it combines two types of online challenges I have enjoyed this year . . . learning how to draw on my tablet through sketch-noting,  and learning how to code with Scratch during Getting Unstuck.

Drew carts and backdrop on tablet, and uploaded.
Made ""costumes"" to put different sprites in carts. 
Coded path of sprites.
Checked layers - made sure distant path was back one layer, and close up moved to front.
Made clouds look wispy and float across the sky.

Choose Your Own Adventure is a series of children's gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome.

The stories are formatted so that, after a couple of pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings.

Use the Events blocks (broadcast, when backdrop switches, etc.) to code a project that lets the viewer choose the outcomes of the story.

2) Your little planet is bombed by some asteroids

Rotate the planet (use Left and Right arrows to decide verse and velocity of the rotation) to make the asteroid hit the aliens and not the trees and the mountains of your beautiful little world.

* Note that the asteroid can hit an item only when it is close to the planet (i.e. on the opposite side of the planet respect the point it came from).

* Note that the asteroid can hit an item only when it is close to the planet (i.e. on the opposite side of the planet respect the point it came from).

After starting on a few different ideas, I landed on creating a concentric circle generator that accepts input from the user via the slider. 

The process is simple. It stamps a circle, changes costume, reduces size, and repeats a number of times specified by the slider.

The number of circles that are drawn is stored in the nCircles variable. The slider feature of this variable enabled. Instead of drawing the concentric circles every frame, the script instead responds to when the value of nCircle changes. There's a note in the script that points to where this happens.

One feature that could be added is moving the center point of a stamped circle each iteration to generate images similar to Marcel Duchamp's Anémic Cinéma rotoreliefs.",Use the slider to change the number of concentric circles.,"Reflection

One feature that could be added is moving the center point of a stamped circle each iteration to generate images similar to Marcel Duchamp's Anémic Cinéma rotoreliefs.Use the slider to change the number of concentric circles.",26264460,JacobAtInnovEd,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235823446_480x360.png,2018-07-08T13:54:43.000Z,2018-07-12T17:01:20.000Z,2018-07-12T13:29:10.000Z,29,9,1,,,8,2,4,0,1,3,1,31,20,0,['en']

Getting Unstuck day-8
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I explain how counting is done in binary numbers.

For the ""bit"" I used a Sprite with 2 costumes (0 and 1). This Sprite has several local variables (its properties), such as its value (0 or 1), its position (0=least significative bit, 1=second signitificative bit, etc).

The Green Button increase the first bit, when a bit pass from 1 to 0 (overflow) it set the variable Destination to its Position+1 and send a broadcast message to all the sprites yelling ""overflow!"".
The bit that have the Position corresponding to the Destination (i.e. the bit at the left of the bit that raised the overflow) is then incremented and (if necessary) it can raise the overflow again...
So the global variable Destination is used to select which bit must respond to the broadcast message.

The number of bits is not fixed from the beginning (you start with just  1 bit). If a further bit is needed it is created by cloning the one who is about to raise the overflow.
A Lightening represent the overflow which propagates through the bits.
The global variable Count (showed at screen) counts in decimal number.
","*** Do you know how to count in binary?
*** Press the Green Button to increase the binary number shown!

At the beginning you have just a single bit 0, when you press the button it becomes 1, when you press the button again it cannon grow again (in binary the only symbols allowed are 0 and 1) and therefore it get back to 0 raising an Overflow (represented by the Lightening) to the bit at its left. If such a bit does not exist, it is created... so you can count from 0 to +Infinite in binary numbers!","

The speed of the vehicle in MPH is calculated at the second circuit point and published on screen. As a math dropout I'm always unsure of my calculations so I would appreciate feedback on these.

If the calculated speed is between 8 and 9 mph (a nod to the 88 mph benchmark established in Back to the Future), the background changes briefly.

PROBLEMS: 1) this calculates the average speed over a stretch of track, but is it possible to calculate speed at a specific location? One can shorten the gap between circuits but the conceptual problem remains. 2) Is there a threshold amount of time needed for makeymakey to recognize that a circuit has been completed? 3) Passing through the circuits slows the vehicle down, based on how I've engineered the wires. Is there a better way to engineer this so the vehicle isn't slowed down? 4) Can the program be improved, possibly by adding another circuit to the course, so that the slowdown at each circuit point is calculated, and the speed at the final circuit is suitably discounted? 5) Scratch's moonwalking isn't very good.","v. 1 the beginning of a physical computing project to measure the speed of a matchbox car at a given point in space

I wasn't feeling this project today (because reasons) but I wanted to stick with it, so I decided to take the ""easy way out"" and remix another project. The reason I say that is that I always want to make my own thing and remixing someone else's work feels a bit like cheating, or at least a short cut. 
But I am convinced of the remix spirit. I was able to do more remixing this video in half an hour than I would have been able to do on my own. Using the video function of Scratch is a blast, and the simple bubble popping action was perfect to add a variable to and turn into a ""game"" that ends when you hit an arbitrary number. 
I was already fairly comfortable with variables, so it was great to use today's prompt to discover a different unknown aspect of Scratch.","Pop the bubbles or just watch them float up the screen.

- Animate the bubble when it pops.
- Change where the bubbles come from.

714,8,236245174,Getting Unstuck: Day 9 — Generative Art,"Reflection

I wanted to improve on my Day 7 project in which multiple cloned pens draw sine waves to the screen. Instead of using dumb agents (that's the technical term) I integrated the color touch block so that the pens can respond to their environment.

The idea is simple, randomly pick a place to start a pair of smart agents, randomly choose a direction for the first agent and a user-defined offset (controlled by the slider) for the second, and let them move until they detect black, at which point they stop.

Overall, it works pretty well. However, one issue is the color touching block looks specifically for black. Because of anti-aliasing drawn lines, some of the pixels are dark grey and don't register with the color sensing block. I could complain, but I think the generated compositions look better because of this glitchiness. ",Move the slider and watch as the art emerges.,"Reflection

I really struggled with this and never got it to do what I wanted. The second I read the challenge I knew I wanted to make a chameleon. I can't draw well enough for that, so switched to a butterfly.
I fought with the color changing for almost an hour and a half! I WANT to be able to create a variable that senses color and then changes the sprite to match that color. I could not figure out how to do that. I tried to create a block that would recognize color, but no. I then fell back on ""if touching color x"" ""set color to x"". Looking up all the color values. That doesn't work - FYI - I still don't really know why.
I then simplified my background to only 4 (sorry about how lurid) colors and learned that the value you set in color is altered by the color at which your sprite starts! When it was white, the color change was so infinitesimal I couldn't really see it! Okay, turned it to a nice vibrant purple and then one color at a time experimented with numbers until they shifted to a reasonable approximation of the desired color.
Thanks to MrQuentin for bearing with the increasingly unhinged ranting that accompanied today's project and figuring out that part about the original color of the sprite affecting the color changes!

When it was white, the color change was so infinitesimal I couldn't really see it! Okay, turned it to a nice vibrant purple and then one color at a time experimented with numbers until they shifted to a reasonable approximation of the desired color.
Thanks to MrQuentin for bearing with the increasingly unhinged ranting that accompanied today's project and figuring out that part about the original color of the sprite affecting the color changes! 
I wonder if the previous iterations would work now that the sprite is purple, but will have to test that later.Click the green flag!",18341966,kboyceq,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236324009_480x360.png,2018-07-13T14:11:21.000Z,2018-07-14T01:07:09.000Z,2018-07-13T16:19:43.000Z,13,8,1,,,9,8,0,0,0,5,2,45,17,0,['en']

819,8,236328571,Day 9 Getting Unstuck - paint bucket blueout,"This is incomplete, but it does use color detection per the Getting Unstuck challenge.

One difficulty I encountered was figuring out how to draw on a sprite with the pen. You can't do that, but you can use a stamp to get the image of a sprite on the backdrop then hide the sprite as suggested at https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/114508/?page=1#post-1008090.

I might be able to solve the bug by starting the drawing on the mid point of the area to be filled at the same y value where I clicked instead of starting at the click location. I ran out of time to pursue this since there are so many other challenges to try.  There is also another bug that shows up when trying to fill the start that's a little different.","Click anywhere to fill all non-black areas of that object with blue. 
This runs painfully slow unless you use enable Turbo Mode (under the Edit menu) before running.

Bug: It does not fill above or below where you click if that area is narrower than where you clicked.

I learned that if a sprite is covering the slider variables, you can't touch the slider variable (I thought the sliders were always on the top layer, but I guess I'm wrong), and I also found that the way transparency/ghosting was handled in this project to be fairly clever (It's a second sprite layer with a white background).

I tried to use Make a Block, repeats, and variables to keep the program as efficient as possible.

The only trouble I had was in getting the needles to be empty of stitches on the first row, then to have stitches on each subsequent row. I ended up creating a variable to keep track of whether it was the first row or not and use that to determine which costumes the needles were showing.

The program is also kind of slow (or maybe meditative? Perhaps I should add some soothing music...(UPDATE: Music added!)).

(1) Any idea how to remove the white background of the beer can (which seemed to be transparent when I found the image)?
(2) Instead of having the bear wildly meander when the user hits the space bar, I'd love to have this action initiated when the user walks the bear into the beer can (ie, the sprites touch).
(3) There seems to be a problem with having everything reset when hitting the ""c"" key -- it requires that it be clicked on two times. What's that all about? Also, is there a way to get the bear to revert to its original angle (straight, not tilted)?

(1) Any idea how to remove the white background of the beer can (which seemed to be transparent when I found the image)?
(2) Instead of having the bear wildly meander when the user hits the space bar, I'd love to have this action initiated when the user walks the bear into the beer can (ie, the sprites touch).
(3) There seems to be a problem with having everything reset when hitting the ""c"" key -- it requires that it be clicked on two times. What's that all about? Also, is there a way to get the bear to revert to its original angle (straight, not tilted)?
THANKS IN ADVANCE!Make the bear walk in different directions with the up, down, left and right arrows. Hit ""space"" to let him ramble around.

1125,5,236001609,Getting Unstuck: Day 6 — Snow,"Reflection

I learned something new about the random block: It can output integers or floating point numbers. For example, this will select a whole number from 1 through 10:

(pick random (1) to (10))

If a decimal values are used as parameters then a decimal value is returned. For example, the following will produce a number between 0.0 and 1.0:

(pick random (0.0) to (1.0))

However, I also just learned that decimal numbers with a .0 are truncated to whole numbers when the projected is loaded back up. So there's a bug in Scratch. To get around this, instead of using -1.0 and 1.0 for the jitter, I set the value range to -1.1 and 1.1, which keeps the values from truncating. I also used 4.9 and 16.1 for generating the size of the snowflakes.

More on the random block at the wiki:
https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Pick_Random_()_to_()_(block)

1175,5,172785629,day 6 - Guess My Colors,"In this game the program randomly generates an urn containing balls of different colors, the urn might contain more than one ball of the same color. We have balls of eleven different colors: white, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, green, blue, brown, black, grey.

The game has two level, on the first level the urn is composed of 5 to 9 balls, in the second level there are 10-15 balls.

Your task is to guess what’s inside the urn by counting the occurrence of colors in the extractions. Note that extractions are nondestructive, i.e. once extracted a ball is reintroduced in the urn.

For example, 300 extractions from an urn (containing: 3 red balls, 1 black, 1 yellow, and 1 purple) might result in: 150 red, 56 black, 47 yellow, 47 purple. To guess the colors in the urn the player ought to construct the following list [red, red, red, black, yellow, purple].

Experimenting with random generators might be fun if you can automatize the extractions and the process of counting what has been extracted. 
","Start by extracting (click the ""Extract"" button), than click ""Count"".

This one was a little ambitious. I chose to make a Guess Who game where both the player and the Scratch cat choose a face, then ask & answer questions to narrow down the choices until they can guess which face the other chose. The randomness is incorporated in two places: which face the Scratch Cat chooses and the order in which the questions are asked.

It's a work-in-progress. Right now the cat asks the questions, but the way he does it doesn't quite work. There should be 5 questions total, enough to narrow down the choices to 1, and he should ask different questions until that happens. Unfortunately he asks the same questions multiple times, and he doesn't ask all the questions. I could have him ask them in the same order every time, but that would make the playing field uneven - depending on which face was chosen, either the cat or the player would have an advantage, and if you knew which face to pick you could win every time (unless the cat picked the same face). 

I'm sharing as a draft because, well, I have to go make dinner now. But I'll try to fix it later.

UPDATE: I fixed the question issue, so it asks each question once. The code I had to do that was mostly fine, but the block that reset the counting variable used to iterate over the list was in the wrong place.

New issue: it's not eliminating the correct faces in response to the player's answers to the questions. I think this is, again, a list-related problem. I'm currently running the program with the faces list displayed to see what's going on.

Again, the code to reset the counting variable was in the wrong place. I fixed that, but it's still not eliminating the right faces.

UPDATE 2: IT WORKS!! I used this project from ListWizard: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11260012/#editor to see an example of how to delete items from a list. I needed to change the variable that iterates through the list by -1 after deleting the item. I think I get why, since the length of the list has now changed, but I'm not 100% percent sure why it works.

Creativity:
I had already used random variables (by chance) in yesterday's project, so I wanted to go a bit further in my exploration of HOW random variables can influence a project. To fully grasp the effect of randomness, you need a large sample size... so I made sure to have lots of clones of a sprite, each random in some way.

Production:
I decided to test changing three different variables for a single sprite. There is also the question of HOW the randomness affects those variables. So, I ended up having 9 different conditions, so that's 9 nested ""if-then"" loops. I was helped by a fellow Scratcher's observations that variables can be different for each clone of a sprite, so I didn't have to figure out how to duplicate a whole bunch of variables 165 times (or more!).

Getting Unstuck:
I actually got ""pre-unstuck"" by thinking about what I wanted to achieve and then looking through some similar projects before getting started. Because I knew what I wanted to do, I was able to hone in on strategies that I felt would be useful for my project.
I did want to go further, by examining how to apply the random effects to each element in the grid, or the same random effect to all of the elements at once, or to some subset of the grid, for example, row-by-row. However, that would have meant at least three more conditions to test, for at least 27 overall... Ooof! Maybe another time.

I had to find something new to learn or experiment with. Since I think the Scratch turtle miss a fill block, I took the chance to create a procedure that emulate it. 

The perpendicular lines are drawn at random positions. Also the cells to fill with color are chosen in the same way.

What I would have do with more time
===========================
I would have traced better the lines, with some thicker and layered an algorithm for drawing with a more realistic simulation.
Actually the drawing are similar (read I utterly copied it) to https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mondrian-composition-with-yellow-blue-and-red-t00648

The most difficult thing
=================
The real hurdle of this project was laying the lines. A really random choose does not do the trick as the lines appear too near each other, or the canvas is not used in his entirety. What I've done is to split the stage into columns (and rows) and tuning them with random adjustment to imitate the  feeling of a Mondrian composition.
The result is quite satisfactory to me.

Creativity:
Changing a Sprite's appearance reminded me of an Alice in Wonderland scenario, where she grows bigger or smaller based on what she eats. My froggo friend is Alice, but I also wanted to play with another character changing costumes, as well as changing the background in response to events in the script.

Production:
Used a lot of ""broadcast message"" blocks to coordinate the activity between all the different sprites. I also realized that if I wanted to run two parallel sequences (like talking and moving) that I could create two scripts that each start with the same event (green flag, or message) and that they would run at the same time. No more fiddling around with wait blocks.

Getting Unstuck:
I was stuck in one area, where I wanted a script to repeat until a specific message is broadcast. You can start a script with a message but you can't end a loop with a message. So I had to Google for some help and found a workaround where you set a variable to 1 with the message and then set the loop to run until the variable = 1.
I'm still unclear about how some events are timed in Scratch, such as what happens when you have a ""wait"" block versus the ""say"" block or the ""play sound"" block, each of which has a certain duration, but what happens to the rest of the script during this time?",Just press the green flag!,"Getting Unstuck Day 4 Costumes

* having the planets resize via the ""b"" key but also ""snap"" back to normal automatically while also ""falling"" and changing location with each pass. 


","This is a two player game meant for connecting to Makey Makey. 

The  idea is that Player 1 (the rocket) can only move side-to-side (like in Galaga) while Player 2 controls the size of the planets as they scroll down the screen. 

The object of the game is for Player 1 to dodge the planets by pressing the left arrow/right arrow keys,  while Player 2 can scale the  planet 1 with the up arrow and planet 2 with the down arrow. 

Players could make custom, 2 button space themed controllers that would trigger the keyboard keys.

- Fail A LOT
(glitches and other weird, unexpected responses can be very fun to discover, and sometimes bring something even more exciting!)

- Take A Break

- A Stack at a Time

- Break It Down 
(this was especially helpful when I wrote out the cues for who was singing and dancing when, which would ultimately lead to the broadcasts)

- Answer Someone's Question 
(very helpful as a fairly new scratcher to have reminders that there are plenty of things I do know, and that I can ask questions to figure out that which I don't)

- Be Inspired By Others

Creativity: 
I wanted to use a gif, as I learned how from another scratcher recently to import a gif to make an animated sprite. I also wanted to make more of a game-type project, with a score and a clear end-point. Often, the sprites I use depend on what I can find through Google Image Search :-/ So, NyanCat flies through space!

Production:
Lots of sprites, each with animation. It was fun and easy to make a sprite blink quickly between two or three costumes to give them more interest. Getting the objects flying through space at an appropriate speed and spaced out enough was also difficult. I feel I could still improve that aspect of the game.
In addition, I did manage to make NyanCat react every time it got hit, but I wasn't quite sure how to use the ""Touching sprite"" sensor in such a way as to only react once, rather than continuously as the two sprites passed over each other. I ended up putting ""Wait"" blocks in my ""If touching"" blocks, but as always, I wonder if there isn't a more elegant way of doing this.

Getting Unstuck:
So I've realized that I always think there is a more elegant way of doing things... but I rarely go look for it or ask for help. I do like to try to figure things out on my own. I have been using the ""help"" commands more often. Part of it is that I'm not sure how to find the specific information that I'm looking for. 
Another scratcher recently remixed one of my projects and indicated another way of doing something (waiting for keyboard input), so I've made sure to reuse that new strategy in this project.","Click the green arrow, then follow the onscreen instructions.","Getting Unstuck Day 5 project, jumping and flying

In addition, I did manage to make NyanCat react every time it got hit, but I wasn't quite sure how to use the ""Touching sprite"" sensor in such a way as to only react once, rather than continuously as the two sprites passed over each other. I ended up putting ""Wait"" blocks in my ""If touching"" blocks, but as always, I wonder if there isn't a more elegant way of doing this.

Getting Unstuck:
So I've realized that I always think there is a more elegant way of doing things... but I rarely go look for it or ask for help. I do like to try to figure things out on my own. I have been using the ""help"" commands more often. Part of it is that I'm not sure how to find the specific information that I'm looking for.

I showed her how to make a sprite scroll up to give the impression that another stationary sprite was falling.  She made the suggestion that the Scratch Cat look like he is shrinking when he flies to catch the ballerina.  Every time we ran the program, Mik would read the speech bubbles and act out the voices of the character.  I should have just recorded her voice and played the sound for each of the exclamations. :-)

1742,4,236152395,Jumping Music,"I shared a slightly different version on my test account! I was thinking about it and thought it would be interesting if the jumping things were music notes that hit the notes at their peak. 

I find this really mesmerizing to play with with big number of notes. 

Update: Just added chord changes after being inspired by @jsh's project Drops.

===Notes from the original===
I wanted to make something for the Getting Unstuck prompt about jumping (but ultimately also incorporated music and randomness). I didn't know exactly what I wanted it to be like, but I thought it would be fun to have lots of interactive things jumping. So I started with some clones and went from there. 

While making this, I experimented with different ways to make a smooth jumping effect. At first, I was doing it the ""math"" way, with a parabolic equation. But I found that confusing in terms of getting the effect that I wanted, and I knew that the code would be big and hard to look at! So I switched to the ""physics"" way, by having a y velocity that I constantly changed with gravity, and repeatedly changing the y position.

Of course, either would work (and they're very related) but the ""physics"" version felt more like I was using the affordances of Scratch and was easier for me to think about, so I stuck with that.

I also added ""play note"" sounds. I experimented with different scales, using lists, and ultimately landed on Bb blues.
 

","Wave your mouse to make them jump.

Change the number of jumping notes with the slider.

A lot of project in scratch use a side view of a flying character.
It was time to a switch of perspective. To render the fligth I tried to leverage on the shadow of the glider. 

When you are higher the shadow is bigger and lighter, as you approach the soil it get darker and shrink.

I'd liked to refine the shadow behaviour but the core concept is here. Time to accept a compromise and pass on the next project of the Getting Unstuck Challenge.

It was so fun to explore the Scratch community and look at other projects to see what kinds of sprites Scratchers have made! I'm not a particularly good artist, so I often find the Backpack to be really helpful for remixing. With credit, of course! Also, walk cycle studios are a great place to find sprites for remixing.

***If I had more time...***
I would want to make the animation more natural looking, especially when Cat2 turns around. I wonder about making them smaller, so that the stage looks bigger? Or should one cat move off-screen? 

***Questions I have...***
I struggled to change the color of Cat2 using the color effect, probably because the original sprite is so light colored (the Scratch wiki says that it's harder to do color effects with black, so I imagine that shades of gray would be similar). Help! How do I do that?

The initial concept involved thinking about blood cells eating a bacteria. That is way too complicated for me at this point, so I tried to boil it down to the most minimal but similar interaction, which ended up being two objects passing each other in a hallway. (I thought maybe the blue and yellow would somehow intersect and turn into green, one absorbing the other.)

This pushed me toward exploring perception and depth of the objects and how they interact in the frame. I wanted to make it seem like one was getting closer to the other and vice versa.

Turning them into planet-like objects came after I started playing with changing the background to give more of a sense of motion.

I found the interface complicated. I assumed the sprites and pieces of data would reset to a default state when you reset the program. However, they don't... so I got super confused when I tried to make my planet spin. When I decided to revert to my original code, the timing and position were completely off and different from what I had originally.

1816,0,235567679,Ice and Fire - Unstuck Day 1,"Phase one

At first I decided to keep the project as simple as possible, but it was too simple: two LHC particles are shot through the screen until they collide, apologize and annihilate the universe (sort of).

It was a very simple project and it was really boring to code, nothing to learn and nothing to think about. At least if I would not want to write on how to cheat with homeworks and get bored to death.

Usually, when I get stuck this way, I start looking for inspiration.

This time I was loosely inspired by an old example of Context Free Art http://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/view.php?id=185

I keeped the squareness of the patterns but, after a couple of failed attempt I tracked the trail of the sprite to understand the patterns I was coding. It looked good and I got the first version of the project.

The following version got evertime more complex, I had to choose two different colors for differentiate the trail of the sprites, choose to rotate a little the patterns to have a more pleasant look.

Phase two

At this point the project was done: time to have a little fun and optimize it. 
An aspect I dislike of Scratch is the interface.The screen become cluttered as you start to stack more than a few blocks and then I have to simplify and encapsulate as much functions I can or I get confused. No, zooming out does not do the trick, maybe a collapse would but we do not have such a function.

The trickest part was the sync of the sprites on collision. I knew I should have used the messages but went for the syncronization by waiting blocks. Bad idea. The sprites keep to start at the same time, or, a sprite started to talk but the other did not respond.

What I would do with more time:

I'm quite satisfied of the result so far. An amelioration would be to change the patterns to have hexagonal or triangular shape. I was thinking that just needed a change of a couple of parameters, but I was wrong. I have to take some time to get a grasp on it.

Phase three 

The funniest one, as I really love to peruse the other projects to see the different approaches people have on common problems. Or the creative choice they made to give life to their projects.

""One's destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.""—Henry Miller

Prompt: Create a project that whenever two sprites collide, one of them says, ""Excuse me!"" and the other sprite says, ""Certainly."" 
","I approached this challenge by 
first: making two different sprites bounce around the stage
two: having one respond when they touch
three: timing the other one to respond upon touching
and then tweaking everything until adequate.

I'm wondering if broadcasting might have been a better way to do this for timing purposes. I'm also curious to see how others handle what happens after the collision of the two sprites. Do they keep moving in the same directions? Different directions? Are you ok with another ""excuse me?"" ""certainly"" popping up immediately after?","Getting Unstuck: Day 1

1884,0,235621375,Unstuck - Day 1,"Thank you, Karen and Paulina for these Unstuck Challenges!  I cannot wait to do all of them.  After looking at the instructions, I have decided that I would like to do these with my daughter.  Watching her learn and talk through her thought process will help me understand how a student might think their way through the project.  So here's some of our dialogue from today's challenge: 
Me: Let's read the directions and figure out how we're going to do this.
Mik: Ok
Me: Now that you've read the directions, what do you want the project to look like?
Mik: Can I pick any sprite?
Me: Sure, but let's not spend too much time deciding.
Mik: Ok, lets use the Scratch Cat.
Me (while we are looking for sprites): Do you want both of the sprites to move or just one?
Mik: Both.  Let's pick one that's pointing away from the cat so he turns around when the cat runs into him.
Me: Ok - how about the Dog2?
--------------------
Me: Because our sprites will be changing directions and moving, I like to initialize the program by setting their starting positions and directions. (***later we realized that we would be changing size as well, so we set the starting size too)
--------------------
One of our first troubleshooting issues we ran into was when we tested the program and the dog did not move.
Me: Hmm, the dog quickly turned around and the Scratch Cat didn't move, but quickly said, ""Excuse me.""  Why?
Mik: I don't know.
Me: Well, let's look at the code.  When is the cat supposed to say ""Excuse me?""
Mik: When it touches the dog?
Me: Are the two touching each other when we press the green flag?
Mik (tries it): yes
Me: Maybe we need a wait command.
Mik: ok, where should we put it?
Me: Well, let's look at the code - the first few things happen quickly, but we need them to move to their locations before they move.
Mik: Let's put it right before they move.
We tested it and it worked.
---------------------------
At one point, Mik wanted to use the send a message command (she remembered this from a previous project we worked on where sprites were having a conversation).  So we discussed where in her code this would work well and I explained how she could call the message whatever she wanted. 
-----------------------------
Throughout the creation project, my daughter wanted to add more and more.  Even though we accomplished the challenge, I wanted to see where her creativity would lead her.  
Mik: I want the dog to get smaller so he looks like he's moved to the side so the cat can pass.
Me: Ok, lets shrink him - where do you think this would be?
Mik: Under looks (she looks through the blocks) what about set size to?
Me: Let's try it.  When do you want this to happen?
Mik: After he say's, ""Certainly.""
Me: Ok, now if we are going to be changing the size, what do we need to do at the beginning? 
Mik: Set his size to big.
Me: Let's do it.
----------------------------
Me: How are you going to get the cat to keep moving after the dog gets smaller?
Mik: Use a broadcast?
Me: Exactly - do it.
---------------------------------
After running the code, Mik wanted the animation to look even more realistic.
Mik: Can we make it so the dog gradually gets smaller, not suddenly skipping?
Me: Sure, lets try changing his size little by little - try a change size by block.  But you want it to keep getting smaller, so what does it need?
Mik: We could make it repeat.
At this point, I showed her how to gradually change size by 1 twenty five times to go from 75 to 50. 
Me: if we use a 1 it will get bigger, what should we do to make it get smaller?
Mik: Negative 1?
Me: Try it -- perfect.
------------------------------
We could have kept going, but I explained that we already kinda went above and beyond.  I really enjoyed watching my daughter express herself through this activity.  She was really excited and enjoyed the challenge.  If only we had time to sit with all of our students one on one to see their thought process in action.  This is where pair programming and reflections could accomplish similar goals. Getting the kiddos to think about their thinking is important.

1926,0,235645823,Getting Unstuck Day #1: Collision,"Getting Unstuck Day 1

Sprite-sprite collisions are always tricky for students - for example, which sprite should ""own"" the collision detection? How do you avoid race conditions when both sprites collide? For this challenge I opted to avoid using broadcasts and instead went with a simpler approach that has each sprite detect collision separately and respond independently using timers.

To up the challenge level I decided to create a ""wander"" function to replicate a behavior students frequently ask for but have difficulty replicating. A couple of surprising difficulties arose out of this.

First, I couldn't easily couple timed costume changing animations with a smooth movement function. For the cat I resolved this by setting a separate forever loop to animate the costume, but for the dog I attempted a more sophisticated approach that still required a separate forever loop, but uses the mod of a constantly incrementing variable to determine when to animate, which has the benefit of easily stopping animation when the two collide at the cost of being more difficult for a student to understand (would be simpler if Scratch exposed a ""frames elapsed"" var like it does for seconds or minutes).

The second issue is one the frequently trips students (and me!) up when combining collisions at animations - the sprites' collision footprint changes every time the costume changes, which makes it more finicky than feels necessary to respond to collisions only once. I had to push sprites off by several pixels any time a collision was detected to avoid recolliding when the costume changes.",,,1092342,jpcaldwell,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235645823_480x360.png,2018-07-06T04:02:20.000Z,2018-07-06T04:58:49.000Z,2018-07-06T04:23:06.000Z,6,2,1,,,1,6,1,0,0,6,2,41,16,4,[]

When I started, I had a few goals in mind. I wanted to create a situation in which two sprites are always colliding with one another. This was accomplished by simply having the two sprite walk back and forth.

A second goal of mine was to ensure that the conditions of the project always start the same way. Location, direction, color, etc, are initialized at the beginning for both sprites.

I wanted to organize the the program. This was accomplished using the a define block for checking collision, and creating a broadcast/receive pair.

Last, I wanted to add a delay to prevent the dialog from being re-triggered should the sprites collide for multiple frames in a row. I learned to use the timer so that there is a minimum 2 second delay before a collision will trigger the dialog again.

Creativity:
I started thinking about a story where one character might say ""Excuse me!"" to another, which got me thinking about how Canadians are stereotyped as excessively polite. There's the beaver. American Independence Day was only two days ago, so there's the eagle. Those sprites I had to find online, as these animals did not exist in Scratch's library. A bit of fiddling to get them the right size, with transparent backgrounds. Where would a beaver and an eagle interact? At a lake. The lake background comes from Scratch's library, and the heron that's already there provided the ""conflict"" necessary for any good story.
Production:
A bit fiddly, as I mentioned, to get outside images into Scratch. As for the code, I am not convinced that there isn't a more elegant way to take care of the timing between the ""thought bubbles"" of each character, rather than just hard-coding all the glide, wait, and thought blocks. Likewise with the collision at the end. I used an ""if"" block, but I have a feeling that there are more elegant ways of accomplishing that little bit of interaction.
Getting Unstuck:
There was a lot of testing and iterating to get the timing right for the thought bubbles. Initially, I had ""forever"" blocks around the ""if"" blocks to sense when the two characters were touching, but I realized I didn't need them as the two characters would only touch once, and in a defined sequence. It's not like in a game where two sprites might touch at any time, so you would need the ""forever"" block to account for that.","Nothing to do, just press the green flag!","Part of the Getting Unstuck project.

2199,1,235711054,Unstuck - Day 2,"This was a tough challenge!  But we enjoyed making it!  Again, I worked with my daughter to complete this project.  Here are some things we tried.
First we found a background that would be suitable for planting flowers.
Then we created a flower sprite with three costumes. We wanted a different flower to appear where your mouse was pointing each time you clicked your mouse.
We experimented with the stamp block under pen, but could not make the flower appear when we clicked, so we added the if...then conditional with a mouse down sensing block in it.  It still wasn't working.  I explained to my daughter that when you clicked the green flag, it only checked one time to see if the mouse was down, so we would need a forever block wrapped around it, so the program would constantly check to see when the mouse was down.  The stamp feature still would not work, so we experimented with the create a clone of myself block.  It was working, but only one flower would be stamped, so we added a next costume block.  Now it printed three different flowers all at once.  Adding a wait block solved that issue.  Next, we wanted to hide the initial flower, so we added the hide block before the forever and put in a show block after the if...then conditional.  Finally, we had to decide whether or not to keep the Scratch Cat.  Of course, we kept him - he's the hero.  He gives the user a purpose and directions for planting a garden.

After looking at other people's projects, I liked how jrushing72 used functions to define drawing random sized/colored flowers.  I may use that example for my define a block lesson later this year.  I also found a project that had a similar problem as mine and I made a suggestion to add a wait block.

Creativity: 
I realized right away that if you kept clicking and adding more flowers, the screen would get really full so that there would have to be some way for the flowers to disappear or be removed. I decided that their petals would fall to the ground before they faded away.

Production:
Fairly straightforward with a bit of testing and iteration. Drawing the flowers with Scratch's drawing tools was not that difficult. I did run into a bug where the flowers wouldn't change colour each time I clicked, because I put the code for that inside the ""When a clone is created"" block, rather than before the creation of the clone. That means each clone started at the first colour and only changed colour once, so they all ended up at the same colour. Additionally, I had some trouble working out the code to make the size of the flower depend on the y-position of the mouse when clicked. I did have to use my math skills on that one to figure out how to make the size a function of the y-position.

Getting Unstuck:
I went back to good old paper and pencil to graph the size of the flower as a function of the y-position of the mouse. I used y=mx+b and initially messed up on calculating my b value. The great thing about Scratch is that when I tested it, I saw immediately that the program wasn't doing what I expected it to do, so that I knew I had made an error. Not sure I would have caught that without the immediate feedback. Not so much getting unstuck with my coding as my coding helping me get unstuck with my math!

I have got a new Idea, plant a seed and let the flower grow for a while and then wither,

The result is the project you see on the left.

What I would have done if I had more time.

Lets say that already used a little more time to create the project, I would have added an minimalistic ambient music, and maybe revert to the original project.

As usual the sprite editor is not the best of the ones I've tried in this years but, it does his work quite well.

2429,2,235761629,Scratch-808 Drum Machine,"Reflection

I decided to build a drum machine. I built one in Scratch many years ago, but there was some issues with the timing of sample playback. So I decided to use today's topic as a reason to rebuild it from scratch. While the tempo is still a little janky, it's a major improvement over the original. I'm also hopeful this will run better in Scratch 3, as my experience with it indicates that it is far more strongly timed than Scratch 2.

To make this project work, I make extensive use of variables and cloning.

If I were to spend more time on this, I would use samples from a real Roland-808. The presentation could be improved on. I could also organize this better by placing duplicated code into custom blocks.

Update: Refactored the code which increases the performance of the drum machine. Instead of having 5 step button sprites for each row, only 1 step button is used to spawn all 80.

Originally, each of the 80 step buttons we're responsible for responding to triggers. Hence, 80 if blocks were being run per trigger. Now the trigger logic has been moved into a single sprite, so now only 5 triggers / conditional blocks are used.

The result is a more strongly-timed drum machine. That is, it's less janky.

Update 2: Found a way to improve timing. Inside the clock sprite I created the ""update step"" block and enable ""Run without screen refresh"". Then I moved over the code from the ""When I receive  trigger"".","1) Press the Play button to start.
2) Control the tempo with the slider.

I have been wanting to sit and compose an electronic piece of music using Scratch, but never really sat down to do it.  I took the ending line from a song that has sentimental value to me and my family and arranged it using Scratch.  I assigned the Scratch Cat the soprano line and gave Giga the descant.  My daughter helped out (and practiced her music reading skills) by reading off the notes to me while I coded them.  When we finished, we experimented with the instruments and adjusted the tempo.  Not bad for our first attempt with creating harmony.  In the future we'll play around with changing the tempo at the end and adjusting the volume level of each voice.

This isn't exactly what was asked for but I did play around with sound.

I wanted to have a series of frogs and when you clicked on each frog it played a different note.  But I couldn't find different frog noises and I wasn't able to change the pitch from within Scratch.

The main difficulty I had was trying to get the frogs to sound off together.  It seems that you can't have the one sound starting multiple times.  So used a random start time to at least have the sound happen a couple of times.

If I had time, I would upload a few different sounds so we can have a true chorus!","Frog Chorus!

I've been trying to imagine my own ideas first before checking out other people's work for Getting Unstuck...but I've never used time-related blocks before! (gasp) So I broke my own rule and poked around a bit — and I saw a lot of numbers, which typically scare me off. But I wanted to push myself, so I looked for a basic structure to remix.

I knew one of my all-time favorite projects from

If you look inside at the code you'll see an explosion of blocks all over the place.. I think they are sound evidence of a deep tinkering process and a rich creative learning experience, something that should be valued rather than stigmatized when we assess students' work.

I also learned a lot about clones and performance, continuously pushing the boundaries to see what was possible to achieve, instead of changing strategies, even when I could see a better alternative solution.

I prioritized inquiry, exploration and investigation over efficiency and getting ""right answers"" or making the ""right project"", in the spirit described in the wonderful article shared today: http://www.papert.org/articles/ComputerAsMaterial.htm

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I simulated how a mechanical clock works.
The project is not intended to be a precise clock (there are obviously better ways to do it).
A pendulum is used as oscillator, performing a regular motion depending on its length (physics tells us how the period is related to the length and it is unrelated to the mass). At each 1/4 of period the pendulum raise an impulse (actually a broadcast message to the needles). Each needle when receive the impulse rotates of a fixed amount, depending on the period of the pendulum and the ""role"" of the needle (hours, minutes, seconds). In reality it depends on the gears that connect needles to the mechanism.
The user can change the length of the pendulum and see the results.
The pendulum block uses the Timer to establish at which time raise the broadcast message.

I knew I wanted to be able to move my sprite around and have it catch a regenerating object.  I had to search a lot to figure out the timer.  All the YouTube videos I watched used a variable for the timer, which was NOT the challenge.  I finally began searching the scratch wikis and that helped me figure out that the timer will not stop, it will only reset.  So then I just had to program the score variable to stop after 15 seconds and make sure when the game started that everything reset to 0.  Then it was a little bit of a struggle to get the start/during/end backgrounds to do what I wanted.

I remixed the very nice project by @Ladyra with the following improvements:

- Translated the messages in English.
- Added not Italian letters (J, K, W, X, Y)
- Simplified the word-search routine (it checked manually for all the letters instead of using a cycle).
- Added a second sprite (the Dinosaurs), so now the Cat say the first part of the sentence and the dino say the second part.
- The control is alternated by the two sprites by means of broadcast messages.
- There is a little chance that the Dino say the wrong word. In this case the Cat asks him to repeat the answer and counts the errors.
","Write you name and the characters will play spelling your name with words. 
Don't expect the Dino is perfect.. maybe if he have known the alphabet, he would not be extinguished now :(

- Send and recieve broadcast: This was my first attempt, and it served the purpose of not creating a clone until after the delay. It also, however, created a new clone for each of the existing clones on the screen (as each was receiving the broadcast separately, I assume). This made for a kind of fun version where you need to eat tacos quickly to avoid a taco explosion, but not quite what I was looking for.
- Function: My second attempt was to create and call a function that waited and then cloned. The ""wait"" inside my function blocked execution in the loop from which it was called (execution blocking commands are tricky!), so it didn't behave any differently than if I had just called the wait and clone inline.
- Hide: This is the one I ended up going for - just hide the clone I plan on deleting right away so it doesn't really matter that it doesn't get deleted until after the clone is created.

Other approaches could include using a timer or a non blocking alternative to wait (like the mod of a counter var), but I'm gonna leave well enough alone :)",Use the mouse to get the dog to eat those tacos!,"I stumbled a bit on the clone replication with this one, as I wanted to delete tacos that were eaten and then pop up a new one after a delay.

Reflection - The screen is a bit crowded and Fred the worm could do with an upgrade. Not exactly to the brief but I had fun with it.         



""Ode to Joy"" (German: ""An die Freude"" [an diː ˈfʁɔʏdə]), is an ode written in the summer of 1785 by German poet, playwright, and historian Friedrich Schiller and published the following year in Thalia. A slightly revised version appeared in 1808, changing two lines of the first and omitting the last stanza.

""Ode to Joy"" is best known for its use by Ludwig van Beethoven in the final (fourth) movement of his Ninth Symphony, completed in 1824. Beethoven's text is not based entirely on Schiller's poem and introduces a few new sections. His tune[1] (but not Schiller's words) was adopted as the Anthem of Europe by the Council of Europe in 1972 and subsequently by the European Union.

Reflection - The screen is a bit crowded and Fred the worm could do with an upgrade. Not exactly to the brief but I had fun with it.         



""Ode to Joy"" (German: ""An die Freude"" [an diː ˈfʁɔʏdə]), is an ode written in the summer of 1785 by German poet, playwright, and historian Friedrich Schiller and published the following year in Thalia. A slightly revised version appeared in 1808, changing two lines of the first and omitting the last stanza.

""Ode to Joy"" is best known for its use by Ludwig van Beethoven in the final (fourth) movement of his Ninth Symphony, completed in 1824. Beethoven's text is not based entirely on Schiller's poem and introduces a few new sections. His tune[1] (but not Schiller's words) was adopted as the Anthem of Europe by the Council of Europe in 1972 and subsequently by the European Union.

I've always been wanting to make a sprite that follows the mouse with their eyes, so this project seemed to be a good opportunity to do it. Then I realized how cool it would be to feature Steven, inspired by project made today by @Mittensproject, @augusto and @aitan

After playing a bit with the imported image, it was clear to me that Steven deserved a vector version. I started playing with the graphic editor and I got stuck there! My strategy today was ""keep going"" and that made me to spend hours to create Steven, my first vector sprite ever! I was so excited and proud that I couldn't stop, so I also made vector graphics for the scratch blocks, inspired by the awesome illustrations made by the Getting Unstuck team.

Feel free to use Steven and the script blocks in your projects, you can also add new costumes or improve them!

A simulation on gravity acting on a falling apple.
I used 3 scenes, representing 3 different gravitational system: Earth, Moon and Jupiter.
In each of them you can simulated an apple falling subjected to the gravity force. The timer is used to keep time and increment the apple's velocity of a constant quantity (which is the acceleration of gravity, g) depending on the particular gravitational system.
The time of the simulation is slowed down to let you observe the motion. As you can see the total falling time is different in different planets due to the different value of g.

At the moment, I am only able to count out the tokens required to show the addition, but I can't get them to regroup by 10s properly. For some reason, my ""repeat"" loop cuts out before looping as many times as I am asking for. I'll have to come back to this one...

If anyone wants to have a look in the ""regrouping"" event for the ball sprite, I would be much obliged!

OK, I've got the regrouping by 10 happening, but I've since learned that I cannot go above 301 clones of a sprite, so I may have to think on this and come back, at least if I want to multiply large double-digit numbers.

I've also modified my scripts to include an idea coming from other Scratchers... instead of broadcasting and receiving from multiple clones (lots of broadcasting, so causing lots of unintended craziness) I should have one uncloned sprite do the broadcasting (and use ""broadcast and wait"" as well) and the clones do the receiving. That way, it's easier to control the timing of all clones' movements. It also helps to conceptualize breaking down the project into smaller steps, much like functions might, with each broadcast block dedicated to doing different things.","Ask Scratch Cat to do any math operation (add, subtract, divide, and multiply) with numbers up to 99.

The Hanoi Towers Game

The main logic is in the Stack sprite, which handles a list of the sizes of the blocks which are stacked in it. The Block sprite have different costumes to represent different sizes.
An extensive use of broadcast message is used to pass game control from the sprites. Nano is the game controller which send appropriate messages to the sprites. Tera gives instruction to the user.
To satisfy challenge requirement, the user can make moves by answering to Nano's questions.","
Hanoi towers is a classical game.

(Click on Tera to see game instructions)

You have three stacks and a series of blocks in the first stack.
You can move the top block of one stack to another stack, with the aim to move all the blocks to the stack 3... but you cannot put a block over a smaller one!
There is a famous solution to the game, but this project is not about computer giving the solution: it is up to you to move all the blocks to their destination!

The life once-considered and yet-to-be-lived in which I was a math major and the life I instead lived at art school as a textiles major are both very excited about this project. This might be the Getting Unstuck project I'm most proud of so far (:

Some stuck moments (of which there were certainly a handful) along the way included initially programming with pen drawing and struggling to get the layering to successfully simulate the weave structure I had in mind (a classic plain weave). At that point I thought maybe I'd set for transparency and realized pen drawings are only opaque. After a brief moment of AHHHH, I realized I could create a long 'thread' sprite which could be transparent, take color data, and be stamped (:

Spreadsheets are an evocative object for me, so I was excited to use Scratch as a similar medium. I also wanted a visual to support a financial argument (an elective cash out mortgage can be sensible) that is anathema to common sense. 

A more refined model would ask for tax rates on dividends/income and would adjust for tax deductibility of interest payments on the mortgage. Mortgages are structured so that interest repayment is weighted toward the start of the loan and principal repayment is weighted toward the tail, which is advantageous to arbitrage but feels unfair if your goal is to get out of debt. A more refined model would also fluctuate the investment returns.

When I have more time I'd like to develop this so one could track payments in real time of an actual (theoretical) loan against a (paper) investment as well as against speculation, as well as spending opportunity costs, e.g. lattes vs. additional principal repayment.

I tried a formula for calculating mortgage payments, based on https://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm, and it indicated a monthly payment that was 100 more per month than the PMT function indicated by Excel.

3443,16,237040422,GCF and LCM: Getting Unstuck Day 17 Lists,"Getting Unstuck Day 17 Lists

In grade 7 math, we teach students to move away from making lists of multiples when finding the LCM, because it can get long with large numbers or 3 or more numbers, and students risk making mistakes with their multiples, leading to an error in their LCM. We teach them to use prime factorization instead. A computer can still use the list strategy because it won't make a mistake on the 1178th multiple, but even a computer takes a while to do it!

Getting Unstuck strategies that helped me with this project:
Sleeping on it
Going through the code step by step
Avoiding making clones broadcasters! (specific to Scratch)
Using descriptive names for my variables

TIL that if you want two clones to share information (clone-specific variables) then one strategy for this is to make a global variable and have one clone ""temporarily"" store its info there so that the other clone can act on it. Two clones cannot share information directly with one to another, as far as I can tell.

If I had more time (or if someone wanted to remix this project), I would either use the prime factorization method for both the LCM and the GCF, or for the LCM (which is the long part for large numbers), I would make the program make a list of (say) the 20 first multiples, check if there is an LCM in that list, list the next 20, check again, etc. This should greatly reduce the time necessary for MOST LCM calculations (except when all of the numbers are prime amongst themselves).","Find the greatest common factor and the lowest common multiple of two or more numbers.

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I realized a very simple RPN calculator.
The starfish asks the user the data to put in the stack (which is a list) and the operation to perform.
Once an operation is specified it get the last two data from the stack and replace them with the result. The latter is ready to be used as an operand for the next calculation.
","When I was a child a teacher of mine had a calculator by Hewlett-Packard (HP) where if you want to calculate 2+3 you must type ""2"", ""enter"", ""3"", ""+"".

I was a bit puzzled... then I studied about it.

The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a notation for math expression where you first put data in a stack and then type the operation you want to perform on the data.
For example, to calculate the sum of 2 and 3, instead of writing ""2+3="" you must enter ""2"", then ""3"", then ""+"".
The good thing is the once you calculated a result it take the place of the operands in the stack, so it can be easily used for another operation.
It could sound confusing, but it is actually convenient!
This procedure allow avoiding parenthesis and confusion about operator's precedence.

If you want to calculate a bit more complex expression like:
   (2+3)*7 = 35
You must enter:
2, 3, +, 7, *

Easy! (or not?)

+ Sprites and backgrounds: All of them have been created with the Scratch paint editor.WELCOME TO ""THE NEXT DOOR"".
Move your character to find the hidden door and get pieces of your spaceship. The door helps you to change your size. When you are on the edge, don't forget to speak or blow into the microphone in order to go to a different room.
*Warning*: when you touch a wall or obstacle you will go to the initial position.
*Tips*: try to have the ideal size to avoid the obstacles.

                                             ---Controls---
Press the green flag and then the play button.
Use the arrow keys to move your character.

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I used some blocks regarding text (for example extracting a single char from a text, or calculating le length of text) together to the function of recursive cloning of sprites.

In this project I used some blocks regarding text (for example extracting a single char from a text, or calculating le length of text) together to the function of recursive cloning of sprites.

The letters are sprites with a costume for each character, the costume of each sprite is selected by analyzing the string. 

The wave effect is given by changing the size of the sprite according to a sinusoidal function with a time shift different for each letter.

In the book, the alien speaks a very particular language full of misspellings and typos, that makes it super cute. So I tried to write a Scratch program to translate from human to alien language.

That turned out to be much harder than expected. I thought I could just replace letters but it turned out that it was much more complex because quite often the translation of a letter depends on the letter that is before and/or after, and there are a lot of exceptions. 

My unstuck strategy was to ""keep it simple"", so I made a couple of simple substitutions. Then I tried consider the previous letter and I made the simplest thing I could, which was ""mispeling"" double letter words. If I had more time I would dive deeper and try to implement the entire aliebn grammar.. for now I think it's cute enough!
