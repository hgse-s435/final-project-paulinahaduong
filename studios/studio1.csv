235480210,Polite cats,"***What did I learn from creating this project?***
It was so fun to explore the Scratch community and look at other projects to see what kinds of sprites Scratchers have made! I'm not a particularly good artist, so I often find the Backpack to be really helpful for remixing. With credit, of course! Also, walk cycle studios are a great place to find sprites for remixing.

***If I had more time...***
I would want to make the animation more natural looking, especially when Cat2 turns around. I wonder about making them smaller, so that the stage looks bigger? Or should one cat move off-screen? 

***Questions I have...***
I struggled to change the color of Cat2 using the color effect, probably because the original sprite is so light colored (the Scratch wiki says that it's harder to do color effects with black, so I imagine that shades of gray would be similar). Help! How do I do that?

Sprites/Project: IcoQuest's Walk Cycle project","I started with a remix, but added a few changes: 
+ Added a second cat and pointed the cat to walk towards the first cat.
+ When they bump into each other the second cat walks around.
+ Changed the music.
+ Added more broadcasting instead of responses to a key press (so that commands are linked to each other and will be easier to update in the future if I don't want the sprites to respond to a space key press).",2745846,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235480210_480x360.png,2018-07-04T15:53:12.000Z,2018-07-04T16:32:06.000Z,2018-07-04T16:20:25.000Z,46,5,1,0,0,146478891,146478891,blank,110,

The initial concept involved thinking about blood cells eating a bacteria. That is way too complicated for me at this point, so I tried to boil it down to the most minimal but similar interaction, which ended up being two objects passing each other in a hallway. (I thought maybe the blue and yellow would somehow intersect and turn into green, one absorbing the other.)

This pushed me toward exploring perception and depth of the objects and how they interact in the frame. I wanted to make it seem like one was getting closer to the other and vice versa.

Turning them into planet-like objects came after I started playing with changing the background to give more of a sense of motion.

I found the interface complicated. I assumed the sprites and pieces of data would reset to a default state when you reset the program. However, they don't... so I got super confused when I tried to make my planet spin. When I decided to revert to my original code, the timing and position were completely off and different from what I had originally.

235567679,Ice and Fire - Unstuck Day 1,"Phase one

At first I decided to keep the project as simple as possible, but it was too simple: two LHC particles are shot through the screen until they collide, apologize and annihilate the universe (sort of).

It was a very simple project and it was really boring to code, nothing to learn and nothing to think about. At least if I would not want to write on how to cheat with homeworks and get bored to death.

Usually, when I get stuck this way, I start looking for inspiration.

This time I was loosely inspired by an old example of Context Free Art http://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/view.php?id=185

I keeped the squareness of the patterns but, after a couple of failed attempt I tracked the trail of the sprite to understand the patterns I was coding. It looked good and I got the first version of the project.

The following version got evertime more complex, I had to choose two different colors for differentiate the trail of the sprites, choose to rotate a little the patterns to have a more pleasant look.

Phase two

At this point the project was done: time to have a little fun and optimize it. 
An aspect I dislike of Scratch is the interface.The screen become cluttered as you start to stack more than a few blocks and then I have to simplify and encapsulate as much functions I can or I get confused. No, zooming out does not do the trick, maybe a collapse would but we do not have such a function.

The trickest part was the sync of the sprites on collision. I knew I should have used the messages but went for the syncronization by waiting blocks. Bad idea. The sprites keep to start at the same time, or, a sprite started to talk but the other did not respond.

What I would do with more time:

I'm quite satisfied of the result so far. An amelioration would be to change the patterns to have hexagonal or triangular shape. I was thinking that just needed a change of a couple of parameters, but I was wrong. I have to take some time to get a grasp on it.

Phase three 

The funniest one, as I really love to peruse the other projects to see the different approaches people have on common problems. Or the creative choice they made to give life to their projects.

""One's destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.""—Henry Miller

Prompt: Create a project that whenever two sprites collide, one of them says, ""Excuse me!"" and the other sprite says, ""Certainly."" 
","I approached this challenge by 
first: making two different sprites bounce around the stage
two: having one respond when they touch
three: timing the other one to respond upon touching
and then tweaking everything until adequate.

I'm wondering if broadcasting might have been a better way to do this for timing purposes. I'm also curious to see how others handle what happens after the collision of the two sprites. Do they keep moving in the same directions? Different directions? Are you ok with another ""excuse me?""

I approach this by:
- making one sprite moves around the stage while it says or does something at specific moments.
- switching backdrops when a sprite touches the edge by using messages.
- showing other sprites with different effects at a specific backdrop.
I've learned that there are simply ways or more difficult ways to do the same thing.

235621375,Unstuck - Day 1,"Thank you, Karen and Paulina for these Unstuck Challenges!  I cannot wait to do all of them.  After looking at the instructions, I have decided that I would like to do these with my daughter.  Watching her learn and talk through her thought process will help me understand how a student might think their way through the project.  So here's some of our dialogue from today's challenge: 
Me: Let's read the directions and figure out how we're going to do this.
Mik: Ok
Me: Now that you've read the directions, what do you want the project to look like?
Mik: Can I pick any sprite?
Me: Sure, but let's not spend too much time deciding.
Mik: Ok, lets use the Scratch Cat.
Me (while we are looking for sprites): Do you want both of the sprites to move or just one?
Mik: Both.  Let's pick one that's pointing away from the cat so he turns around when the cat runs into him.
Me: Ok - how about the Dog2?
--------------------
Me: Because our sprites will be changing directions and moving, I like to initialize the program by setting their starting positions and directions. (***later we realized that we would be changing size as well, so we set the starting size too)
--------------------
One of our first troubleshooting issues we ran into was when we tested the program and the dog did not move.
Me: Hmm, the dog quickly turned around and the Scratch Cat didn't move, but quickly said, ""Excuse me.""  Why?
Mik: I don't know.
Me: Well, let's look at the code.  When is the cat supposed to say ""Excuse me?""
Mik: When it touches the dog?
Me: Are the two touching each other when we press the green flag?
Mik (tries it): yes
Me: Maybe we need a wait command.
Mik: ok, where should we put it?
Me: Well, let's look at the code - the first few things happen quickly, but we need them to move to their locations before they move.
Mik: Let's put it right before they move.
We tested it and it worked.
---------------------------
At one point, Mik wanted to use the send a message command (she remembered this from a previous project we worked on where sprites were having a conversation).  So we discussed where in her code this would work well and I explained how she could call the message whatever she wanted. 
-----------------------------
Throughout the creation project, my daughter wanted to add more and more.  Even though we accomplished the challenge, I wanted to see where her creativity would lead her.  
Mik: I want the dog to get smaller so he looks like he's moved to the side so the cat can pass.
Me: Ok, lets shrink him - where do you think this would be?
Mik: Under looks (she looks through the blocks) what about set size to?
Me: Let's try it.  When do you want this to happen?
Mik: After he say's, ""Certainly.""
Me: Ok, now if we are going to be changing the size, what do we need to do at the beginning? 
Mik: Set his size to big.
Me: Let's do it.
----------------------------
Me: How are you going to get the cat to keep moving after the dog gets smaller?
Mik: Use a broadcast?
Me: Exactly - do it.
---------------------------------
After running the code, Mik wanted the animation to look even more realistic.
Mik: Can we make it so the dog gradually gets smaller, not suddenly skipping?
Me: Sure, lets try changing his size little by little - try a change size by block.  But you want it to keep getting smaller, so what does it need?
Mik: We could make it repeat.
At this point, I showed her how to gradually change size by 1 twenty five times to go from 75 to 50. 
Me: if we use a 1 it will get bigger, what should we do to make it get smaller?
Mik: Negative 1?
Me: Try it -- perfect.
------------------------------
We could have kept going, but I explained that we already kinda went above and beyond.  I really enjoyed watching my daughter express herself through this activity.  She was really excited and enjoyed the challenge.  If only we had time to sit with all of our students one on one to see their thought process in action.  This is where pair programming and reflections could accomplish similar goals. Getting the kiddos to think about their thinking is important.

Create a project that whenever two sprites collide, one of them says, ""Excuse me!"" and the other sprite says, ""Certainly.""

I've found the prompt very funny and generative. A few days ago I made a Scratch project with my avatar floating into space, so I started from there. I experimented with different ways to move the sprites while keeping the code simple. Just before adding my project to the studio, I checked out other projects. It was awesome to see the variety of projects generated by that simple prompt, and to recognize so many friends who are participating to this online adventure. I loved to see my friend @lilyland reference to getting ""unstuck"" on her sailboat, so I decided to work more on my project, playing with the idea of getting stuck and unstuck. It was really fun!

The issue is with sprites which are irregularly shaped as well as not being centered properly. When the ""if touching"" condition is true, the sprite turns around. But after turning around, it is still touching the other sprite, and hence it turns around again, which results in some weird glitchy behaviours.

We found the best way was just to force the sprites to move away from each other once the condition is true, by adding an extra move block inside. Works the best :)","Just click the green flag :)

235645823,Getting Unstuck Day #1: Collision,"Getting Unstuck Day 1

Sprite-sprite collisions are always tricky for students - for example, which sprite should ""own"" the collision detection? How do you avoid race conditions when both sprites collide? For this challenge I opted to avoid using broadcasts and instead went with a simpler approach that has each sprite detect collision separately and respond independently using timers.

To up the challenge level I decided to create a ""wander"" function to replicate a behavior students frequently ask for but have difficulty replicating. A couple of surprising difficulties arose out of this.

First, I couldn't easily couple timed costume changing animations with a smooth movement function. For the cat I resolved this by setting a separate forever loop to animate the costume, but for the dog I attempted a more sophisticated approach that still required a separate forever loop, but uses the mod of a constantly incrementing variable to determine when to animate, which has the benefit of easily stopping animation when the two collide at the cost of being more difficult for a student to understand (would be simpler if Scratch exposed a ""frames elapsed"" var like it does for seconds or minutes).

The second issue is one the frequently trips students (and me!) up when combining collisions at animations - the sprites' collision footprint changes every time the costume changes, which makes it more finicky than feels necessary to respond to collisions only once. I had to push sprites off by several pixels any time a collision was detected to avoid recolliding when the costume changes.",,1092342,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235645823_480x360.png,2018-07-06T04:02:20.000Z,2018-07-06T04:58:49.000Z,2018-07-06T04:23:06.000Z,6,2,1,0,0,,,,,

When I started, I had a few goals in mind. I wanted to create a situation in which two sprites are always colliding with one another. This was accomplished by simply having the two sprite walk back and forth.

A second goal of mine was to ensure that the conditions of the project always start the same way. Location, direction, color, etc, are initialized at the beginning for both sprites.

I wanted to organize the the program. This was accomplished using the a define block for checking collision, and creating a broadcast/receive pair.

Last, I wanted to add a delay to prevent the dialog from being re-triggered should the sprites collide for multiple frames in a row. I learned to use the timer so that there is a minimum 2 second delay before a collision will trigger the dialog again.

235705525,Competition for Resources: GettingUnstuck1 Collision,"Part of the Getting Unstuck project.
Creativity:
I started thinking about a story where one character might say ""Excuse me!"" to another, which got me thinking about how Canadians are stereotyped as excessively polite. There's the beaver. American Independence Day was only two days ago, so there's the eagle. Those sprites I had to find online, as these animals did not exist in Scratch's library. A bit of fiddling to get them the right size, with transparent backgrounds. Where would a beaver and an eagle interact? At a lake. The lake background comes from Scratch's library, and the heron that's already there provided the ""conflict"" necessary for any good story.
Production:
A bit fiddly, as I mentioned, to get outside images into Scratch. As for the code, I am not convinced that there isn't a more elegant way to take care of the timing between the ""thought bubbles"" of each character, rather than just hard-coding all the glide, wait, and thought blocks. Likewise with the collision at the end. I used an ""if"" block, but I have a feeling that there are more elegant ways of accomplishing that little bit of interaction.
Getting Unstuck:
There was a lot of testing and iterating to get the timing right for the thought bubbles. Initially, I had ""forever"" blocks around the ""if"" blocks to sense when the two characters were touching, but I realized I didn't need them as the two characters would only touch once, and in a defined sequence. It's not like in a game where two sprites might touch at any time, so you would need the ""forever"" block to account for that.","Nothing to do, just press the green flag!",3485356,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235705525_480x360.png,2018-07-06T17:44:49.000Z,2018-07-06T20:35:26.000Z,2018-07-06T18:36:05.000Z,8,2,1,0,0,,,,,

235935936,Getting Unstuck day 1 remix,"So, I decided to make this a collaborative project with my son, NanoWhisp. I let him approach the challenge first, then critiqued and debugged it with him, and I'm doing the reflections.

This one didn't need any serious debugging, although I did refactor it a bit to remove an unnecessary event! Nano used events to communicate between balloon and ball to co-ordinate the conversation. The balloon politely stops moving while the beach ball slowly moves past after saying excuse me - a wonderful characterization! (hi I'm an excessively proud dad right now) And the event routines were very well organized and also I'm excessively proud of that too

Okay, reflection: how would I have approached it differently?
I would have been tempted to make this universal - could we have a LOT of instances of the same sprite, who somehow can negotiate this between any pair, without specifying in advance which one says ""excuse me""?

ie. I overthink things

That aside though, I love the event approach here. You *could* do the whole thing without any inter-sprite communication, just having them each execute a timed script on contact. But the event approach is easier to modify, and in a sense it's more ""natural"".
