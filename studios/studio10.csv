236345220,Cat Radio,"This project was created for Day 10 of Getting Unstuck. The purpose of today's challenge was to create a project that makes use of time-related blocks. 

If I had more time, I'd work on the script and playlist a bit more. But the time-related part was very fun to build and worked out better than I imagined.

My first strategy was to look for these features in the code, which brought me to a list which organized the sound structure. I'd never used lists before, so it was fun to explore to see what I could discover. What I discovered was that it wasn't the list I needed to be tinkering with at all.

It's a reminder that there are many different ways to get things done. so I decided that my project for today would be a remix of Karen's, but I would add a few things to make it more organized.

'Replay value' is a big deal in game design. Even simple games take significant time and effort to code, and the we hopes the hours we put in will create, at least, minutes of fun for the players. This is a challenge, especially when we're new to making games.

I thought of this for Day 10 because the 'timer' block might be the lowest-hanging fruit for adding 'replay value' to a game. Playing a game with a timer changes the challenge from ""can you do XYZ?"" to ""how well can you do XYZ?"" Can you improve on your last performance? Will your time be faster than hers?

I wanted to recreate an old Arduino project I once assembled that acted as a binary counter. It included 8 LEDs that represented the state of an byte, or 8-bit value, in memory.

The challenge for this project is that there are no bitwise operators (that I'm aware of) in Scratch. In order to simulate changing of the bits, I used a list so that each element of the list represents a bit. Building this 8-bit memory, along with the supporting functions, took most of the time.

I took me more time how to move the yarn ball along the stage and stop it at a certain time. I have also problems with the random position of each clone kitten.

+What would you do next with your project, if you had more time?
I'd like to move the yarn ball differently together with more levels.

If you look inside at the code you'll see an explosion of blocks all over the place.. I think they are sound evidence of a deep tinkering process and a rich creative learning experience, something that should be valued rather than stigmatized when we assess students' work.

I also learned a lot about clones and performance, continuously pushing the boundaries to see what was possible to achieve, instead of changing strategies, even when I could see a better alternative solution.

I prioritized inquiry, exploration and investigation over efficiency and getting ""right answers"" or making the ""right project"", in the spirit described in the wonderful article shared today: http://www.papert.org/articles/ComputerAsMaterial.htm

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I simulated how a mechanical clock works.
The project is not intended to be a precise clock (there are obviously better ways to do it).
A pendulum is used as oscillator, performing a regular motion depending on its length (physics tells us how the period is related to the length and it is unrelated to the mass). At each 1/4 of period the pendulum raise an impulse (actually a broadcast message to the needles). Each needle when receive the impulse rotates of a fixed amount, depending on the period of the pendulum and the ""role"" of the needle (hours, minutes, seconds). In reality it depends on the gears that connect needles to the mechanism.
The user can change the length of the pendulum and see the results.
The pendulum block uses the Timer to establish at which time raise the broadcast message.

237650427,Getting Unstuck - Day 10,"Today's challenge is to ""Create a project that uses one or more of the time-related blocks in the Sensing category (i.e., timer, reset timer, current [year/month/date/etc.], days since 2000)"".

I knew I wanted to be able to move my sprite around and have it catch a regenerating object.  I had to search a lot to figure out the timer.  All the YouTube videos I watched used a variable for the timer, which was NOT the challenge.  I finally began searching the scratch wikis and that helped me figure out that the timer will not stop, it will only reset.  So then I just had to program the score variable to stop after 15 seconds and make sure when the game started that everything reset to 0.  Then it was a little bit of a struggle to get the start/during/end backgrounds to do what I wanted.

Credit my daughter for the idea of creating Scratch's cape!

If I could change it... I would write a script to either stop the timer or make it hide after 15 seconds.","Click the Green Arrow to show the starting screen.

Then click the space bar to start the game.
Use the arrows to move and change the directions of the cat.

How many tacos can you catch in 15 seconds?",24696341,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237650427_480x360.png,2018-07-28T22:01:42.000Z,2018-07-29T02:01:42.000Z,2018-07-29T00:54:51.000Z,3,1,1,0,0,,
