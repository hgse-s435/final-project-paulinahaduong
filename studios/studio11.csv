236181324,Getting Unstuck Day 11: Gusbear remix,"For today's challenge, I've remixed my *first ever* Scratch project from 2015. It took me over a week to make this project work how I wanted, at the time!

I specifically chose to remix this project because one of the biggest things I was stuck on when I originally made it was ""how to get everything to disappear at once."" @karenb happened to come by as I was working, and showed me how to use the broadcast block!

I also want to challenge myself to spend more time thinking about how to integrate Scratch into content-area classrooms for the second and third weeks of Getting Unstuck. When I first encountered Scratch, my main goal was to figure out how to incorporate creative computing into my 6th grade math classroom.",Click on the green flag and let Gusbear help you practice fractions.,19163721,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236181324_480x360.png,2018-07-12T02:25:27.000Z,2018-07-21T21:00:18.000Z,2018-07-12T23:21:03.000Z,14,4,0,0,0,76778164,76778164

I made this to better understand the very clever key changing script used in the original.

I invested a lot of minutes in working on the timing.

Thanks to all the other remixers of the project that did this before me. It was fun and challenging working inside the same space as others while trying not to break existing work. The most difficult part in doing this remix is that I wanted all my added material to exist within a single sprite so that I wouldn't convolute the project with lots of additional sprites.

One thing I did which was extremely helpful was that I developed most of my contribution in a separate project. Then I moved everything over using the backpack.

Originally, I tried adding a mouse control script from a previous project I created.  I thought it would be a simple drag and drop fix, but it didn't work with the number of sensing scripts in the project.  Instead, I had t develop a new method to have the sprite follow the mouse on click and stop following on clicking the background all while still making use of the color and sprite sensing scripts.  Ultimately, I followed the example of the original project and used the custom block control, which made it much easier to add the necessary code to several scripts.

Remixing was rather fun, as the original creators -  @ECS_Scratcher and rbotero - already had great animations and sensing scripts.  ","Click on Scratch cat and use your mouse to save princess!

I learned to think and plan ahead.  I made many timely mistakes while stumbling upon the result.

The part that I found the hardest was using the background editor.  I'm not sure when to use Bitmap vs Vector.  I was originally putting the tree and the grass on the background and was pulling in transparent clipart, but the editors were doing funky things.  Later I figured out that I needed the tree to be a sprite so that I could keep it in front of the paint splats.","Getting Unstuck Day 11 - Find a project that uses broadcasting and remix it.

by Massimo Marletta

I remixed the very nice project by @Ladyra with the following improvements:

- Translated the messages in English.
- Added not Italian letters (J, K, W, X, Y)
- Simplified the word-search routine (it checked manually for all the letters instead of using a cycle).
- Added a second sprite (the Dinosaurs), so now the Cat say the first part of the sentence and the dino say the second part.
- The control is alternated by the two sprites by means of broadcast messages.
- There is a little chance that the Dino say the wrong word. In this case the Cat asks him to repeat the answer and counts the errors.
","Write you name and the characters will play spelling your name with words. 
Don't expect the Dino is perfect.. maybe if he have known the alphabet, he would not be extinguished now :(

237052686,Getting Unstuck Day 11,"Getting Unstuck Day 11 Reflection:
I started this project for a Scratch class a month or so ago, but I didn't get a chance to finish it.  Is it cheating to remix your own project?!  Remixing helped me save different versions of my project, so I felt a little more comfortable trying different things with it.  I didn't get quite as tangled up in my scripts as I have in other projects.  I don't know how I feel about remixing other projects - I looked for a water cycle one to remix instead of using my own, but I didn't see one I wanted to tinker with.  How do people find projects to remix?  I can see the value in remixing, both for myself and my students, but I didn't find a good search strategy for finding something to remix.
