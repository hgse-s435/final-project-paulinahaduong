For this project I decided I'd explore the vector editor and a walk cycle with the changing scenes. After a bit of playing, I enjoyed using the vector editor and I'm excited to continue to work with it. I'm feeling OK about the walk cycle for a first go -- would like to create more steps so that it appears smoother. Continuing with the project I'd also like for the background to appear as moving, too! I started to look into scrolling sprites, though that will be a challenge for another day (: I'd also like to have interactive features with each scene.

A simulation on gravity acting on a falling apple.
I used 3 scenes, representing 3 different gravitational system: Earth, Moon and Jupiter.
In each of them you can simulated an apple falling subjected to the gravity force. The timer is used to keep time and increment the apple's velocity of a constant quantity (which is the acceleration of gravity, g) depending on the particular gravitational system.
The time of the simulation is slowed down to let you observe the motion. As you can see the total falling time is different in different planets due to the different value of g.

I wanted to stretch my comfort level, especially since this project deals with variables. I've used variables for scoring, but not much else. I liked this idea because in addition to score it uses variables to set the speed and angle of the penguin. At first the game was too easy. All you had to do was point at the iceberg. I had to play around and tweak the speed and gap to get the penguin to launch at the angle I wanted.

I figured out how to add lives when a certain score is reached, but I'd like to be able to add a life at certain increments, for example at every multiple of 50. I'm sure it must be an easy math calculation, but I couldn't figure out how to do that. Any suggestions would be most appreciated.","Click the green flag to begin.

237239643,Wandering - Getting Unstuck 12,"The main credits is to the long novels ""Intraworld"" by Neil Gaiman and Michael Reaves, which you need to know to fully appreciate this work. Or at least go in a library or a bookstore and peruse a couple of pages, please ;-) 
I used the english translation of the italian title to have an excuse for creating a 007 like intro.
The hardest things to obtain was to enlarge the text beyond the maximum size allowed by Scratch and obtain the spiral effect zooming out the text. It uses a trick I had to google hard to find.
AND YOU CAN HAVE TO ALMOST FREE: just open the project and read the code (ask for help in the comment if needed)!

238391008,Visiting the house of Scratch,"My original idea was to share some of the places I'm going to visit during my upcoming holidays, visiting my friends and family in Italy.
I wanted to start the journey by going out of the Media Lab, but I realized that it would have been cool to let other people in the lab, to visit this incredibly playful and inspiring place.

I'm pretty satisfied with the project, especially because I was able to make it in a short time. Yesterday I've been spending hours working on a different project idea but I realized that I need more time for that.

So my design response to this project is ""yes!"", I hope it might be ""wow!"" for someone else! :)
