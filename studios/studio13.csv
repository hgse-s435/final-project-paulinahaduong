I like the discovery aspect of the project. Two things I'm still thinking about:
(1) Do I have bugs? The logic of my program seemed straightforward in theory:
   cat is initially fussy
   if you leave it alone for long enough, it is not fussy
   if it is not fussy, you can pet it
   if you pet it for too long, it gets fussy again
But the implementation seem convoluted. I need a code review. :)

In this project I used the block ""distance from mouse pointer"" to calculate the Coulomb repulsion force between two electrons (which is proportional to the inverse of the distance between them).

I had a lot of fun drawing costumes for the electron sprite with my children.
","In this project we have a bored electron: yes, a poor negative charge all alone in the void space.
The mouse pointer is another electron and you can apply Coulomb force to the bored electron simply getting close to him.

236647298,Taco Dog,"I stumbled a bit on the clone replication with this one, as I wanted to delete tacos that were eaten and then pop up a new one after a delay. Because ""delete this clone"" must be at the end of a sequence, I tried several apporaches to initializing a new clone one second after the previous was removed, each with surprisingly different results:

- Send and recieve broadcast: This was my first attempt, and it served the purpose of not creating a clone until after the delay. It also, however, created a new clone for each of the existing clones on the screen (as each was receiving the broadcast separately, I assume). This made for a kind of fun version where you need to eat tacos quickly to avoid a taco explosion, but not quite what I was looking for.
- Function: My second attempt was to create and call a function that waited and then cloned. The ""wait"" inside my function blocked execution in the loop from which it was called (execution blocking commands are tricky!), so it didn't behave any differently than if I had just called the wait and clone inline.
- Hide: This is the one I ended up going for - just hide the clone I plan on deleting right away so it doesn't really matter that it doesn't get deleted until after the clone is created.

Other approaches could include using a timer or a non blocking alternative to wait (like the mod of a counter var), but I'm gonna leave well enough alone :)",Use the mouse to get the dog to eat those tacos!,1092342,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236647298_480x360.png,2018-07-17T15:19:38.000Z,2018-07-17T16:11:18.000Z,2018-07-17T16:01:46.000Z,12,6,1,0,0,,

Reflection - The screen is a bit crowded and Fred the worm could do with an upgrade. Not exactly to the brief but I had fun with it.         



""Ode to Joy"" (German: ""An die Freude"" [an diː ˈfʁɔʏdə]), is an ode written in the summer of 1785 by German poet, playwright, and historian Friedrich Schiller and published the following year in Thalia. A slightly revised version appeared in 1808, changing two lines of the first and omitting the last stanza.

""Ode to Joy"" is best known for its use by Ludwig van Beethoven in the final (fourth) movement of his Ninth Symphony, completed in 1824. Beethoven's text is not based entirely on Schiller's poem and introduces a few new sections. His tune[1] (but not Schiller's words) was adopted as the Anthem of Europe by the Council of Europe in 1972 and subsequently by the European Union.
