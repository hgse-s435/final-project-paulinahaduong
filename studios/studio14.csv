236591011,Truffle's Idea Tumbler,"updates on this iteration for Day 20:
I made a few detail edits, such as adding in spaces between the responses that Truffle joins as an idea. Sometimes when trying something new, the details are missed, and I'm glad to come back to this! I also added a feature where you can add a question to Truffle's memory. What question might bring some playful ideas?

original notes:
AHHHHH - This was my first time exploring strings and lists!
^---- that's a very excited ahhhh!

At first I wasn't even sure what the string blocks might be used for. I started off by looking at the Scratch wiki (https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/String) to see what they even did. (thanks @paulinah)! Then I thought that I would create something that generated randomized text. 

The most exciting part of creating this came as I was thinking of questions to ask. As I plugged in Ask "" "" and wait, and ""add answer to list"" at least 15 times, and saw my code grow longer and longer, I wondered how I could randomize the questions so that they might appear in another order (or be repeated, for re-considering other potential responses.) I thought, if I could put them somewhere and ask for a random one, that would be great. I had just created my first list of the answers to questions. It was a sparkly realization moment when I thought ""what if I stored the *questions* in a list, too??? This way, they could both be randomized when called upon and ALSO be more organized, not making my script forever long. I was honestly feeling kind of unsure about taking on lists -- and there I was, creating lists on lists to be joined in (lovingly) weird strings! I'm excited to see where this new discovery goes!

During the recent Getting Unstuck project on changing scenes, I decided to try a ""pause and come back"" strategy in stuck moments. When I paused, I'd go in the vector editor and work on this cat face, thinking I'd surely use it for something in the future. I felt comfortable enough to play around with creating the cat while also thinking through the challenges in the project I was programming. For this challenge, I didn't spend ANY time on drawing, as I'd already created the cat. I wonder how far I would've gotten in the lists + strings exploration if I were also focusing on creating my own graphics?","After pressing the green flag, press the space bar to start.

This was a fun little project to do and came together fairly quickly.

How it works: After the users answers Scratchy, the script processes it by pulling out only the letters of the alphabet while creating variables forward and reverse.

In this project I used some blocks regarding text (for example extracting a single char from a text, or calculating le length of text) together to the function of recursive cloning of sprites.

The letters are sprites with a costume for each character, the costume of each sprite is selected by analyzing the string. 

The wave effect is given by changing the size of the sprite according to a sinusoidal function with a time shift different for each letter.

Took a while to figure out how to get the first letter moved to the end.
So happy when it worked, almost forgot to add ""ay"". Timing still not quite right and project seems to have gone from a few extraneous bowtie spins to not quite enough - will probably compare to previous drafts. Still thinking through the progression of steps when using the broadcast block, strings, loops and direction changes. 
Would not have considered remix before Day 11 challenge. Glad to have a model to work from, and not always having to start from ""scratch"".

236797413,Aliebn Lamguage,"The inspiration for this project came from one of the most wonderful and inspiring stories I've ever read, ""badly spelled and beautifully written"", in which a little alien lands on Earth to find out what is a human.

In the book, the alien speaks a very particular language full of misspellings and typos, that makes it super cute. So I tried to write a Scratch program to translate from human to alien language.

That turned out to be much harder than expected. I thought I could just replace letters but it turned out that it was much more complex because quite often the translation of a letter depends on the letter that is before and/or after, and there are a lot of exceptions. 

My unstuck strategy was to ""keep it simple"", so I made a couple of simple substitutions. Then I tried consider the previous letter and I made the simplest thing I could, which was ""mispeling"" double letter words. If I had more time I would dive deeper and try to implement the entire aliebn grammar.. for now I think it's cute enough! EDIT: I couldn't resist so I also made a simple filter that removes ""I'm"" or ""I am"" from the second answer.. it is not very robust, but it's good enough!
