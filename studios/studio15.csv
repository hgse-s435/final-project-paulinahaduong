236729012,Day or night? (v2),"A more minimalist project, remixed from an old project. I was a little pressed for time, but it was also a good reminder that these challenges are intended to be quick and easy, even if it's also so easy to get sucked into the work! 

It's also funny to go back to old projects and see how your style was different. For some reason, in the old one, my noise-dependency if it was loud was a forever loop triggered by the sound, whereas if it was soft, it was an if statement inside a forever loop. There are only two options though - why not wrap them both in the same forever loop? *headshake*",Just press the green flag!,2745846,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236729012_480x360.png,2018-07-18T09:41:32.000Z,2018-07-19T09:19:18.000Z,2018-07-19T09:19:18.000Z,32,9,0,0,0,,

While I was playing with an idea for a different sound-based project, I kept wondering what the ""loudness"" block was really capturing.

236794148,Star Songs,"As I thought about what to create for sound detection, I wanted to see how I could have clones of something represent the shifts in sound visually. I decided to give myself a very short time limit to create a simple sprite in the vector editor (to continue exploring the drawing to programming time ratio in creating my projects). I ended up creating this star which led me to think of a twinkling night sky.

Initially I had intended to have more sensing ranges. As I would run my program, unexpected movements were happening, and the changes I was hoping for were not. I decided to simplify and just have two possibilities, above or below 30. At this point, I was able to get the visual effects I wanted (which included trying what I thought I wanted and deciding I *didn't* want that a few times) The program was running, though, so that was great! 

Boiling effects down to their most simplified and then building on that is a strategy I could probably benefit from using more. My mind often goes real big rather than starting small, and I think that I'd like to try building big and wide from simple, more easily trackable (and therefore tinkerable!), steps.","Press then green flag, and then sing (or scream, whatever you need,) to the stars!

This week, I only have a few minutes for my own Scratch projects each morning, so I'm curating the same few ideas over several days. One thing that I wish I could explore further is using advanced algorithms to make the music (note and instrument selection, sound bending, etc) and other functions smoother.

From Unstuck 14, two exciting discoveries were (1) using mouse x and mouse y to change notes, and (2) using a pointer finger on the track pad to draw without ever clicking. I want to push further with these ideas.

- @mres, @natalie, and the @Scratchteam for creating Scratch
- @karenb and the @ScratchEdTeam for getting me unstuck
