236881381,Deep Thought,"This week has been a little short on time, so I haven't been able to spend as much time on the project as I want to, but it does force me to  think about time as a design constraint, particularly for implementing these activities in classrooms. I got the MVP (minimum viable project) working, and then I thought...what else do I have time for? In <30 minutes, there's definitely not enough time for looking for/making sprites, so I stuck with what was in the sprite library. And, it's a reminder that the sprite library is so rich! And I still have a fully functioning project!

If I had more time, I would make the answers more respondent to the questions, instead of just at random. Any thoughts on how to do that much appreciated!

236853476,5-Question Scratch Cat Jeopardy,"(For Day 16 of Getting Unstuck)
Today's invitation to make was: ""Create a program that answers the user's questions."" My first thought was to create a Magic 8 ball, but then I tried to think of other situations where the user (or the player) is stating a question. I was reminded of someone from our apartment building who watches Jeopardy in one of the building's common areas every evening and used that as my inspiration. I took the questions from Jeopardy's online practice test sets (Teen edition).

The only thing I could think of that directly answered the prompt was some sort of magic 8 ball... which is cool, but not what I wanted to make! Eventually, with the help of @paulinah, I remembered a great gift I received for Christmas—foodie dice! They're meant to help you decide what to eat. So, I decided to turn this into my project :)

It's not exactly answering a question the user *poses*, but I think it's definitely a question lots of people have!

I'd like to come back to this later and add in more options, store the options in a list, and then only show the options available for those conditions.

236925961,Tell Me More,"I got most stuck conceptualizing this project. I had a difficult time thinking about how to frame questions and answers in this context. Initially I wanted to try to really have the answers ""make sense"", that is, for the project to listen well and respond accordingly. Listening is HARD, and teaching a computer how to listen well seemed too large a hurdle any of the attempts I made at it. 

So, I wondered how I might highlight that dilemma in the answers. I thought some more about listening, to each other and ourselves, and wondered how I might make a list of responses to think with. I ended up searching to see if I could find an interview by teacher + teacher educator Eleanor Duckworth. I thought I'd take the ""answers"" from there. (I didn't have a particular interview in mind, just that I'd like to to find one.)

I found 'On Thinking about Teaching: A Conversation with Eleanor Duckworth', and pulled out some of her responses and this project unfolded (:

The duck splits the words of the question and uses the first word - probably the question word. It looks in a list Q for this word and if it's there it uses a corresponding reply. With more time I would extend the code to check the whole sentence to allow it to scan for trigger words like Orange or Quack and create a response. 

You can see the lists used Q and A - dive in and remix to add some more replies. The trigger word (if first word in the question) will result in the reply. The last entry in A is the response if no match is found and should always be the last item. ","Getting Unstuck Day 16

-more than one operator entered
-divide by zero
-invalid number format either before or after the operator

At the moment, I am only able to count out the tokens required to show the addition, but I can't get them to regroup by 10s properly. For some reason, my ""repeat"" loop cuts out before looping as many times as I am asking for. I'll have to come back to this one...

If anyone wants to have a look in the ""regrouping"" event for the ball sprite, I would be much obliged!

OK, I've got the regrouping by 10 happening, but I've since learned that I cannot go above 301 clones of a sprite, so I may have to think on this and come back, at least if I want to multiply large double-digit numbers.

I've also modified my scripts to include an idea coming from other Scratchers... instead of broadcasting and receiving from multiple clones (lots of broadcasting, so causing lots of unintended craziness) I should have one uncloned sprite do the broadcasting (and use ""broadcast and wait"" as well) and the clones do the receiving. That way, it's easier to control the timing of all clones' movements. It also helps to conceptualize breaking down the project into smaller steps, much like functions might, with each broadcast block dedicated to doing different things.","Ask Scratch Cat to do any math operation (add, subtract, divide, and multiply) with numbers up to 99.

The Hanoi Towers Game

The main logic is in the Stack sprite, which handles a list of the sizes of the blocks which are stacked in it. The Block sprite have different costumes to represent different sizes.
An extensive use of broadcast message is used to pass game control from the sprites. Nano is the game controller which send appropriate messages to the sprites. Tera gives instruction to the user.
To satisfy challenge requirement, the user can make moves by answering to Nano's questions.","
Hanoi towers is a classical game.

(Click on Tera to see game instructions)

You have three stacks and a series of blocks in the first stack.
You can move the top block of one stack to another stack, with the aim to move all the blocks to the stack 3... but you cannot put a block over a smaller one!
There is a famous solution to the game, but this project is not about computer giving the solution: it is up to you to move all the blocks to their destination!
