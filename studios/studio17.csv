Today seemed the perfect day, using list data to create potentially-hideous (and potentially pleasing) color combinations in weave structures, depending on your input!

The life once-considered and yet-to-be-lived in which I was a math major and the life I instead lived at art school as a textiles major are both very excited about this project. This might be the Getting Unstuck project I'm most proud of so far (:

Some stuck moments (of which there were certainly a handful) along the way included initially programming with pen drawing and struggling to get the layering to successfully simulate the weave structure I had in mind (a classic plain weave). At that point I thought maybe I'd set for transparency and realized pen drawings are only opaque. After a brief moment of AHHHH, I realized I could create a long 'thread' sprite which could be transparent, take color data, and be stamped (: 
(any tips on starting to explore layers in scratch would be much appreciated)

This was definitely part of continuing to explore my ""where could I get with programming if I don't focus on drawing...?"" question.
This also felt like something of a redemption from pattern-drawing-day disasters.

237020184,interest rate arbitrage,"For Day 17 of GettingUnstuck, in which we work with Lists.

Spreadsheets are an evocative object for me, so I was excited to use Scratch as a similar medium. I also wanted a visual to support a financial argument (an elective cash out mortgage can be sensible) that is anathema to common sense. 

A more refined model would ask for tax rates on dividends/income and would adjust for tax deductibility of interest payments on the mortgage. Mortgages are structured so that interest repayment is weighted toward the start of the loan and principal repayment is weighted toward the tail, which is advantageous to arbitrage but feels unfair if your goal is to get out of debt. A more refined model would also fluctuate the investment returns.

When I have more time I'd like to develop this so one could track payments in real time of an actual (theoretical) loan against a (paper) investment as well as against speculation, as well as spending opportunity costs, e.g. lattes vs. additional principal repayment.

I tried a formula for calculating mortgage payments, based on https://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm, and it indicated a monthly payment that was 100 more per month than the PMT function indicated by Excel. This eliminated the arbitrage opportunity, so for this simulation I input the Excel PMT result to Scratch. I left a draft block showing how the inflated payment was calculated. If anyone can find an error there, I would love to understand what it is!","Green flag, and watch. This is a crude calculator that simulates mortgage payments balanced against a dividend yielding investment (or interest rate arbitrage). Exponential growth is visually understated (I divided results by 3) so that I could keep visuals on the stage.

Assumptions: 100,000 borrowed for 360 months at an interest rate of 4.7%. Invested in a vehicle that pays annualized 7.1% before taxes via monthly payments. (I used DNP's price and monthly dividends for this model.) Monthly dividends minus pmts are reinvested in the vehicle (no transaction costs assumed).",33815227,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237020184_480x360.png,2018-07-21T15:44:50.000Z,2018-07-21T22:31:34.000Z,2018-07-21T17:19:35.000Z,8,3,0,0,0,,

237040422,GCF and LCM: Getting Unstuck Day 17 Lists,"Getting Unstuck Day 17 Lists

In grade 7 math, we teach students to move away from making lists of multiples when finding the LCM, because it can get long with large numbers or 3 or more numbers, and students risk making mistakes with their multiples, leading to an error in their LCM. We teach them to use prime factorization instead. A computer can still use the list strategy because it won't make a mistake on the 1178th multiple, but even a computer takes a while to do it!

Getting Unstuck strategies that helped me with this project:
Sleeping on it
Going through the code step by step
Avoiding making clones broadcasters! (specific to Scratch)
Using descriptive names for my variables

TIL that if you want two clones to share information (clone-specific variables) then one strategy for this is to make a global variable and have one clone ""temporarily"" store its info there so that the other clone can act on it. Two clones cannot share information directly with one to another, as far as I can tell.

If I had more time (or if someone wanted to remix this project), I would either use the prime factorization method for both the LCM and the GCF, or for the LCM (which is the long part for large numbers), I would make the program make a list of (say) the 20 first multiples, check if there is an LCM in that list, list the next 20, check again, etc. This should greatly reduce the time necessary for MOST LCM calculations (except when all of the numbers are prime amongst themselves).","Find the greatest common factor and the lowest common multiple of two or more numbers.
Enter all the numbers and say ""No"" or ""no"" when you are done.
If you use large numbers or 4 or more numbers, the program works but can take over 10 minutes (!), so if Scratch Cat is saying ""Hmm..."" for a long time but the timer is still advancing... be patient!",3485356,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237040422_480x360.png,2018-07-21T23:57:20.000Z,2018-07-22T17:01:35.000Z,2018-07-22T17:01:35.000Z,3,1,0,0,0,,

237160855,RPN Calculator,"Getting Unstuck - day 17
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I realized a very simple RPN calculator.
The starfish asks the user the data to put in the stack (which is a list) and the operation to perform.
Once an operation is specified it get the last two data from the stack and replace them with the result. The latter is ready to be used as an operand for the next calculation.
","When I was a child a teacher of mine had a calculator by Hewlett-Packard (HP) where if you want to calculate 2+3 you must type ""2"", ""enter"", ""3"", ""+"".

I was a bit puzzled... then I studied about it.

The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a notation for math expression where you first put data in a stack and then type the operation you want to perform on the data.
For example, to calculate the sum of 2 and 3, instead of writing ""2+3="" you must enter ""2"", then ""3"", then ""+"".
The good thing is the once you calculated a result it take the place of the operands in the stack, so it can be easily used for another operation.
It could sound confusing, but it is actually convenient!
This procedure allow avoiding parenthesis and confusion about operator's precedence.

If you want to calculate a bit more complex expression like:
   (2+3)*7 = 35
You must enter:
2, 3, +, 7, *

Easy! (or not?)

The starfish asks you to type the numbers or symbols you want to enter in the RPN calculator, type each item at once and press enter...",4804940,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/237160855_480x360.png,2018-07-23T15:29:20.000Z,2018-07-24T13:22:13.000Z,2018-07-24T11:27:19.000Z,9,1,0,0,0,,

238370277,Bubblesort - GettingUnstuck-17,"Bubblesort is one of many sorting algorithms, not the most efficient, but one of the simplest to implement so it was funny to play with it on Scratch.
This is just the first iteration: I would like to see the bubbles move when I swap them (and just those involved) instead of redrawing all of them like now. I used the parsing function from the day16.
And, thinking about thinking: bubblesort is not the way our brain sorts numbers, what kind of algorithm do we really use? Is it the same for all of us?","Green flag to start.

238410052,Program Steven,"I wanted to create a todo list for a sprite, then I realized that it is exactly what a computer program is! So I made a very simple programming language on top of Scratch.

I was surprised by how easy it was to build the ""interpreter"", i.e. the ""start"" sprite that reads from the list and broadcast messages to Steven. If I had more time I would implement more programming blocks and I would add the possibility of repeat loops.

Enjoy!
