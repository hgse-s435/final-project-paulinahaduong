I removed the ands and ors and used a not condition to make the program understand that the two cards are the same. I got stuck several times, mainly because I needed to figure how to randomize the lists. I did a list with numbers from 1 to 20 and then randomly it puts them in other two lists, deleting the number so it can't be used again. So card n.1 (the cat) are in position list1 n.1 and list2 n.1. Card n.2 (the crab) are in position list1 n.2 and list2 n.2. Headache? :P
Every clone has a private variable (remember, the sprite variables are also clone variables) with a progressive number, so every time the user clicks on a card, it's possible to know what it is looking for its number in the lists.

Fun facts: the whole game is inspired by an old (early eighties) quiz show, named BIS, where the cells were small slide projectors' screens controlled by wire from a console.

-cleaned up leftover platform clones at end of game.
-added a ""this way"" sprite to show how to get to the next level.

I saw this challenge as an opportunity to build upon and improve one of my previous projects, involving game levels.

I worked through a number of issues with layers, but can't figure out how to place a stick that is moved from the middle of the remaining pile back to it's same location after it is moved to the front. I have to rethink the system of using variables to track the layers.

This might work best abandoning the layers altogether and using some sort of physical controller (makey makey, scratchbit, micro:bit?) and collabroation between one person moving the mouse and another operating the mouse click, press, and release.
","Did you ever play the game pick up sticks? You had to move a stick off a pile without any other stick moving.

* You have to guess a number which satisfies some secret criteria.

* Set your guess with the green buttons (the left one decrease and the right one increase the values showed in the display).

* Click on the key to check if your number is the secret one.

Each of the tree locks (the orange blocks on the right) will move and became blue (indicating you have unlocked a part of the mechanism) if your guess satisfies a criterion. Only if your guess satisfies ALL the criteria the mechanism will be completely unlocked!
(for example if the secret number is 10, the first lock could be unlocked if your guess is multiple of 2, the second if your guess if multiple of 5, ...).

This is really simple, but I got to try a few different operators that I hadn't used before.  MsNykorchuk5's project has more riddles, which is what I'd like to figure out how to do.
I think the and/or/not operators are helpful, but I have to think more about when to use them.  A lot of times the if/then blocks seem to work just as well, if not better.

The inspiration came from a video that I watched today about an installation at Artechouse, where people were immersed in a sea of letters and could interact with them by moving their bodies.

I made a first version pretty quickly but then I realized that I wasn't using the logical operators and I needed a secret to reveal. I got stuck, so I went for a walk. When I came back I had the idea of using the letters to reveal a word. The project got much more complicated but I learned more about clones and I'm pretty satisfied with the final result.

Enjoy!
