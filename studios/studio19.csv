237111696,Lights,"This project was created for Day 19 of Getting Unstuck. Our mission was to explore clones, which I was excited about because I've really been enjoying clones throughout Getting Unstuck (previously, clones were an unexplored feature for me). 

For an initial version of this project, I relied more heavily on Scratch's built-in blocks (e.g., X Position, Y Position, Point Towards, Move X) to calculate movement. But there was a slight problem with this; I wanted the clones to appear to continue their circular motion even when offstage. The solution was to do more of the calculations manually, storing things like current position in variables (so, not limited to the size of the stage).

237113181,EC Maker Game,"This is a sketch for a ""maker game"" I drew two years ago as part of a ""maker games"" project made possible by Tufts CEEO Innovation Fund. Two of us later produced a very different game but I've always wanted to develop this sketch for early childhood students. 

For day 19 of GettingUnstuck, in which the theme is cloning, I'm sharing the sketch and inviting others to remix (i.e., ""clone"") it and develop their own games. Feel free to use, remix, and riff on this backdrop in any context within Scratch (if you use this backdrop please credit me for the drawing). I'm going to be using this as the basis for some game design prototyping in a summer camp class this upcoming week.

The features of the board are listed below with corresponding iterative maker concepts:

school (where players start)
park (for play, rest, passion projects)
design & co (test and (re)design, outsource design)
patent office (protect IP)
general store (obtain new materials)
junkyard (obtain free materials, leftovers etc)
skate park (hack, tinker)
maker bank (obtain funds for new materials*)
movie theater (develop and share documentation/narrative)
public library (research)
museum of makings (exhibit works)
train station [lower left corner] (pitch/present)

This drawing was loosely based on my hometown. At my game design summer camp week we'll be drawing maps as a starting point for some game backdrops as well.

*in some versions of our games players received tokens periodically which could be used to purchase materials. I like to use narrative as currency: players have to tell a story about their progress in order to obtain new building materials.

236681045,Elastic wave,"Getting Unstuck - day 19
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I use clone function to produce a series of particle that vibrates with a slight time shift, forming a mechanical wave.
Each clone have private variables that regulates its oscillation.
","
*** How a mechanical wave is formed? ***

Imagine a single particle which start moving up and down with harmonic motion at constant frequency and amplitude. 

The energy of the particle is transferred to the particle next to it with a slight delay, depending on the characteristics of the medium (the distance between the particles divided by the time delay equals the velocity of waves in that medium).

Therefore the second particle starts its harmonic motion at a different time but with the same frequency and amplitude of the first particle.
The motion is then transferred to the third particle and so one.
That's how an elastic wave is created!

Do you see some particle moving horizontally?
Actually they are just keep oscillating up and down...

Sunflowers were popping up very quickly, so I added more wait time.  Now it sometimes takes a while for flowers to start ""stamping"". 
Will definitely go back to de-bug and refine this project, and to experiment with other methods of cloning.
Sunflower was created for a sketchnoting challenge earlier this year.
Background is from Day 6 challenge (Old MacDonald).

This is a variant of Conway's Game of Life - a cellular automaton. The original uses a grid, while this allows the cells to be placed randomly.

If it has fewer than 2 neighbours (lonely) or more than 3 neighbours (overcrowded), it dies. If it has exactly three neighbours, it clones itself (and the child moves a short distance away from its parent).
