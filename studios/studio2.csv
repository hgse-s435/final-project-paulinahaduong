235601849,Day 2: Flower stamps!,"Originally I drew my own flower (purple circle w/ green petals) and made that move around the screen as a clone, but then I wondered how hard it would be to draw using the pen tool (I am always astounded by @scmb1's use of the pen!). The answer? Very hard! I wanted to recreate my purple circle and green oval petals, but couldn't figure out how to fill them in. Also couldn't figure out how to draw beautiful parabolas.

Anyway, eventually I sought some inspiration from others' pen drawings, poking around the Scratch ""Help with Scripts"" forum as well as just searching the community to find other pen flowers. There were many different ways to accomplish this, but since I had already succeeded in drawing pen circles, I decided to draw connecting circles with random colors in order to make flowers.

Flower drawing loosely based off of this tutorial: https://www.drawingnow.com/tutorials/119946/how-to-draw-a-flower-step-by-step/

I had a lot of fun with this challenge! I wanted to challenge myself to learn something new, so I looked at the flower drawing tutorial and used the paint editor to make my flowers. My students always struggled with the paint editor, so I wanted to spend more time using it to see what might be frustrating for them. It was definitely more time-consuming than I thought!

What you currently see (the random colored flowers) is only one part of what I had hoped to make. I also want to make a little ""flower palette"" where you can choose what color flower to stamp. I couldn't get this to work last night because of the way I programmed the flowers to stamp (any time the background is clicked). You can see what I was trying to do if you look at my ""purple"" broadcast blocks. Would love any advice for how to make this extra part of my project work!","Press the green flag to start.

- the backdrop detects clicks
- it creates a clone of a costumeless drawing sprite for each click
- it uses the pen with a large pen size value to draw circles without having to move the pen

I liked this approach because the clones mean you could be drawing more than one flower at a time. I think it's fun not to have any costumes for the sprite - so no worrying about hiding the original sprite when using clones. I could add some more variety to the flowers drawn by having a whole set of parameters beyond size and colour. Maybe the pen could be used to draw spirograph flowers. Stalks would be fun. Maybe add an animated bee to enjoy the flowers.

235711054,Unstuck - Day 2,"This was a tough challenge!  But we enjoyed making it!  Again, I worked with my daughter to complete this project.  Here are some things we tried.
First we found a background that would be suitable for planting flowers.
Then we created a flower sprite with three costumes. We wanted a different flower to appear where your mouse was pointing each time you clicked your mouse.
We experimented with the stamp block under pen, but could not make the flower appear when we clicked, so we added the if...then conditional with a mouse down sensing block in it.  It still wasn't working.  I explained to my daughter that when you clicked the green flag, it only checked one time to see if the mouse was down, so we would need a forever block wrapped around it, so the program would constantly check to see when the mouse was down.  The stamp feature still would not work, so we experimented with the create a clone of myself block.  It was working, but only one flower would be stamped, so we added a next costume block.  Now it printed three different flowers all at once.  Adding a wait block solved that issue.  Next, we wanted to hide the initial flower, so we added the hide block before the forever and put in a show block after the if...then conditional.  Finally, we had to decide whether or not to keep the Scratch Cat.  Of course, we kept him - he's the hero.  He gives the user a purpose and directions for planting a garden.

After looking at other people's projects, I liked how jrushing72 used functions to define drawing random sized/colored flowers.  I may use that example for my define a block lesson later this year.  I also found a project that had a similar problem as mine and I made a suggestion to add a wait block.

Creativity: 
I realized right away that if you kept clicking and adding more flowers, the screen would get really full so that there would have to be some way for the flowers to disappear or be removed. I decided that their petals would fall to the ground before they faded away.

Production:
Fairly straightforward with a bit of testing and iteration. Drawing the flowers with Scratch's drawing tools was not that difficult. I did run into a bug where the flowers wouldn't change colour each time I clicked, because I put the code for that inside the ""When a clone is created"" block, rather than before the creation of the clone. That means each clone started at the first colour and only changed colour once, so they all ended up at the same colour. Additionally, I had some trouble working out the code to make the size of the flower depend on the y-position of the mouse when clicked. I did have to use my math skills on that one to figure out how to make the size a function of the y-position.

Getting Unstuck:
I went back to good old paper and pencil to graph the size of the flower as a function of the y-position of the mouse. I used y=mx+b and initially messed up on calculating my b value. The great thing about Scratch is that when I tested it, I saw immediately that the program wasn't doing what I expected it to do, so that I knew I had made an error. Not sure I would have caught that without the immediate feedback. Not so much getting unstuck with my coding as my coding helping me get unstuck with my math!

It was a quick solution for me when I couldn't find the sprite I wanted. However, it may take a student longer to come to the same solution. 

2) I also liked adding in the background and the sun.  Having an open challenge like this allows for student creativity.  I can see using this as an extension activity for some of my scratch lessons for my students.

Time to restart and think again on the problem. Note for me: Learn to draw stems, it shouldn't be so difficult! (Any suggestion, Anyone?)

I have got a new Idea, plant a seed and let the flower grow for a while and then wither,
The first part of the project was set, but the withering part let me a little depressed. Better let flowers fly away (and I already had the dandelion seeds).

The result is the project you see on the left.

What I would have done if I had more time.
===============================
Lets say that already used a little more time to create the project, I would have added an minimalistic ambient music, and maybe revert to the original project. 

The look is sketched as I feel it was the best option for this kind of project (apart that I'm not really strong at drawing).

The least pleasant part 
=================
As usual the sprite editor is not the best of the ones I've tried in this years but, it does his work quite well. Just it does not works as I expect and usually I resort to Inkscape to create my graphics. This time I stuck with the standard tools and had to work a little more to obtain something viable.
