236591011,Truffle's Idea Tumbler,"updates on this iteration for Day 20:
I made a few detail edits, such as adding in spaces between the responses that Truffle joins as an idea. Sometimes when trying something new, the details are missed, and I'm glad to come back to this! I also added a feature where you can add a question to Truffle's memory. What question might bring some playful ideas?

original notes:
AHHHHH - This was my first time exploring strings and lists!
^---- that's a very excited ahhhh!

At first I wasn't even sure what the string blocks might be used for. I started off by looking at the Scratch wiki (https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/String) to see what they even did. (thanks @paulinah)! Then I thought that I would create something that generated randomized text. 

The most exciting part of creating this came as I was thinking of questions to ask. As I plugged in Ask "" "" and wait, and ""add answer to list"" at least 15 times, and saw my code grow longer and longer, I wondered how I could randomize the questions so that they might appear in another order (or be repeated, for re-considering other potential responses.) I thought, if I could put them somewhere and ask for a random one, that would be great. I had just created my first list of the answers to questions. It was a sparkly realization moment when I thought ""what if I stored the *questions* in a list, too??? This way, they could both be randomized when called upon and ALSO be more organized, not making my script forever long. I was honestly feeling kind of unsure about taking on lists -- and there I was, creating lists on lists to be joined in (lovingly) weird strings! I'm excited to see where this new discovery goes!

During the recent Getting Unstuck project on changing scenes, I decided to try a ""pause and come back"" strategy in stuck moments. When I paused, I'd go in the vector editor and work on this cat face, thinking I'd surely use it for something in the future. I felt comfortable enough to play around with creating the cat while also thinking through the challenges in the project I was programming. For this challenge, I didn't spend ANY time on drawing, as I'd already created the cat. I wonder how far I would've gotten in the lists + strings exploration if I were also focusing on creating my own graphics?","After pressing the green flag, press the space bar to start.

237208177,"Visual Editor, Improved","This project was originally created for Day 14 for Getting Unstuck, and then revised for Day 20 of Getting Unstuck. I had originally set out to make a multiline text editing box, maybe even with a scroll bar. Wow, that was harder than I thought it would be. So on Day 14, I settled for the ability to enter characters.  

For Day 20, I added support for the Delete and Enter keys. Again, this was much harder than I thought it would be; it actually makes use of an undocumented Scratch feature, described here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19199766/.

236909884,20,"Unstuck day 20
This is derivative of a project I began on day 13 and revised on days 14-15.  I've experimented with: connecting it to makeymakey instruments, bending notes based on the cursor's y position, separating graphix from sound, creating feedback loops through the user's microphone, and with eliminating a need for a user.

In this edition I changed the primary graphic to a spinning ball of thread. Given further time, I'd like to gamify this by creating an additional sprite that one tries to ""catch"" or grab with the fingertip. I think it will be necessary to use the timer and reset blocks to establish whether one has caught the other sprite (to distinguish it from a coincidental on stage passing-by).

An exciting discovery from this project has been the ability to use phantom sprites (e.g., no costume) to shadow other sprites, often by looping a glide instruction e.g. to the x/y of the first sprite. At this phase of iteration I may not be using any phantom sprites in a significant way, but - as we near the conclusion of GU - that's the grist on my mill. Another breakthrough from days 13-15 for me was that I could make these graphix without requiring the user to click or press down on the mouse/trackpad. The gentle fingertip and trackpad activity feels like a new Scratch experience. I'm very grateful for these discoveries! Thanks for the provocations!

Followup: made a remix for PicoBoard so the instrument can be set by a force resistant sensor connected to port D https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/237255829/","Green flag. Move fingertip on touchscreen to change note.

When running my project to check it, sometimes the sprite with the intro words becomes very large & off the screen. (Is this b/c I have both bitmap & vector graphics running at the same time?)

I went through the getting unstuck cards and played with some featured projects. When I returned to my getting unstuck studio I saw my ""robot line follower"" from day 9 and knew it was the one from the notes I'd written about what I'd like to try with more time. I'd never normally write notes like that, so I think I will try to in future to capture my thoughts at the time rather than allowing them to drift away. 

I have been thinking about line following robots. Seemed like the perfect opportunity to try out very simple rules, eg move forwards; if touching red turn right; if touching blue turn left. Seems to work surprisingly well. I like the idea that Scratch could be used to prototype real world robot algorithms.

I started with Scratch Cat rather than a ball, but extremities would ""catch"" on the colours and lead to twirling and getting stuck.

I said: ""I'd like to experiment further with different angles and number of steps. Maybe with a timer to see how fast the ball completes the track. This could be automated to determine the best parameters.""

I've started this. Runs are now automated with randomly selected parameters. I need to sort the list on time to create a proper sense of which parameters work best or even better, plot a surface with the 2 parameters to see the ""shape"" of the parameter space. I also need to add jitter to the start point to see how robust each result is.

Sometimes the robot cheats and returns to the gate by going the wrong way down the track. Maybe need multiple gates to track this?

237272072,water clock,"Getting Unstuck day 20
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I simulated how a mechanical clock works.
The project is not intended to be a precise clock (there are obviously better ways to do it).
I started from a previous project of mine, where I used a pendulum performing a regular motion as the oscillator which gives ""tic"" to the clock. 
In this revised project I use drops of water dripping from a tap at regular time intervals to generate a ""tic"" broadcast message than make the needles move.
Each needle when receive the ""tic"" message rotates of a fixed amount, depending on the period of the drops falling and on the ""role"" of the needle (hours, minutes, seconds). In reality it depends on the gears that connect needles to the mechanism.
The drop block uses ""slide in N seconds"" to generate ""tic"" messages  at regular time intervals.

For this project I revisited an earlier game I made for Day 9 and 18. There was some code that I couldn't get working properly (the food sensing the ant and assigning points based on the costume). I had put a request in the forum and had some good advice. I still couldn't get the code working and gave up. Because the Scratchers giving me advice were ALOT more experienced than I, I figured they must know what they are talking about and the code should work. So I decided to revisit this same project, determined to figure out the code. After looking at it I found the problem (conflicting actions) and was able to make it work, just like they said it should!

I think several things worked:
1) I needed the break from the pervious day to see it all with fresh eyes
2) determination, knowing that the code SHOULD work. Therefore there was a problem somewhere that I needed to find

Inspired by Seymour Papert and Turtle Logo I thought I would use the pen tools and draw things that are a bit like crystal flowers. When doing any Logo I'm always reminded of a photo in the MIT museum of Seymour with one of the big early turtles.

My original version of this (for activity#5) used glide for all the movement of both the rocket and the alien. I saw some great examples of how to ""jump"" in other people's work so updated the alien jump based on that. 

Other future enhancements:
- change rocket flight (it is still basic).
- fix the fact sprite is upside down after bouncing off edge
- fix odd higher jump when bouncing off side (might be due to costume area?)",Press SPACE to lift off and watch how things go.,15872912,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/238557218_480x360.png,2018-08-08T16:42:57.000Z,2018-08-08T17:32:52.000Z,2018-08-08T17:32:25.000Z,1,0,0,0,0,,
238523570,Getting Unstuck - Day 20,"The Getting Unstuck Challenge for day 20 was to copy and revise a previous day's project.  I chose my project from day 9, which was to create a project that uses the ""touching color"" block.  It was originally just the first backdrop, so I extended it to two maze screens and added the variable to keep track of how many times Scratch hits the wall (touches black).

My new version now  also includes challenges from several of the previous days!

Day 19 - Use the ""create a clone"" block
Day 14 - Use the ""join"" block
Day 12 - Have 3 separate scenes
Day 8 - Create a variable to keep track of the number of times something happens
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Getting Unstuck Challenge for day 9 was: ""Create a project that involves the touching color blocks in the Sensing category (i.e., touching color? and color is touching?). For example, you could have a sprite moving around on a colorful background, with the sprite behaving differently depending on which color it is touching, like in a maze game.""

","Click the green arrow to start the maze.

Use the arrow keys to guide Scratch the Cat through the maze.  If you touch any of the walls Scratch will turn around and move back.
