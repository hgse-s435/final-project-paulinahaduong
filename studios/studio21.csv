237312700,Sum of multiples of 3 and 5,"When @karenb and I first got started with these challenge designs, one of our sources of inspiration was Project Euler, which has been one of my favorite ways to learn coding (at first in Python) for a long time. What I love about Project Euler is that it encourages a variety of solutions to a single problem, and once you ""solve"" a problem, you're still encouraged to look at how others did it, as well as consider how you might refactor your code to be more elegant, or faster, or more beautiful, and I love the idea that you're never really done with any of the challenges. It's very mathematically focused, though, so perhaps not appropriate for all audiences, but there are certainly some students who might appreciate them! 

This project is downloaded from @karenb - I changed the background + fixed a bug that was overcounting multiples + added sound.","Press the green flag to get started!

The block that I selected for today's project is the 'username' block from the Sensing category, which provides the username of the person running the project. It's a simple block, but can provide a very personal touch.

237313696,"Ideas, Meet Layers","""Scratch, Meet Ideas. Ideas, Meet Scratch""
Create: 
Either: Start with an idea you're not quite sure how to bring to life in Scratch. Try it, see where it goes! 
OR 
Start with a feature/block/functionality that you haven't used in Scratch. Try it, see where it goes!
(OR, try both!)

Reflect:
Why did you choose the starting point that you did? Where did you imagine you might end up? Where did your process go?

I decided to go with the latter, seeking to play with layers. What can manipulating layers bring to a project? Here I start to think about that with a selection of simple sprites. How will the image shift as layering shifts?

What was I thinking about in designing this challenge?
I've been thinking about the differences between starting the creative process when driven by an idea or concept and when driven by an exploration of a new feature/block/function. What does process look like in each of those? What's exciting about each? What does exploring new feature/block/functionality do for our ideas? And what do our ideas do for discovering features/blocks/functionality? 

A way to start exploring those differences seemed to be noticing which is driving a project, and then noticing process along the way.

(For example, my exploration on Day 10 foregrounded functionality:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/236354120 and on Day 18 foregrounded an idea I envisioned: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/237060823)","Press the green flag, then use these keys to create with layers!

237310116,1s1s splat (1s1s tetris V0.7 remix),"My Day 21 Getting Unstuck prompt...
1s1s: Create a 1s1s project (i.e., a project with only 1 sprite and 1 script).

I was randomly scouring the Scratch Forums and came across a discussion about the ""1s1s"" phenomenon. Here's the discussion thread in question: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/12378/ and here are examples of 1s1s projects: https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=1s1s

As one poster noted, ""Yeah, 1s1s or any of its variations are usually challenges that Scratchers set themselves when making a project to make it more impressive."" I don't know about the ""more impressive"" claim, but there's something interesting about playing with constraints, which is certainly a theme of Getting Unstuck. I've never made (at least not intentionally!) a 1s1s project, so the novelty factor was definitely high!

To be honest, I wasn't at all sure where to begin. I knew I wanted to do a 1s1s, but wasn't sure what types of programs might be best suited to the genre. I love Tetris (so much) so, on a whim, I search for 1s1s Tetris, which led to two results. One of the two results had a version number of 0.7, so I saw an opportunity to extend someone else's neat work, while learning a lot in the process.

In practice, this was kind of a total disaster. (It feels pretty good to end my Getting Unstuck experience with a spectacular failure.) I ended up so confused and frustrated that I turned it into a ""splat"" situation—when blocks land they lose their shape. (But, appropriately, that doesn't even work totally correctly.)","My Day 21 Getting Unstuck prompt...

BUT I woke up this morning with some idea of how 1s1s works! (It's basically one big control loop that does everything. Revelation!) So, I decided to take one of my very classic projects (which is in the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide, it was one of the first game projects I tried to help people learn) and make it 1s1s! This project is that attempt!!!

Compare the code from the original (from 2009!): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/612964/#editor

Turns out to be simple, and very useful! It just waits for the action that is triggered by its broadcast message to finish before it goes on to the next block. If several sprites are responding to its broadcast with different durations it will wait until the last one is done. Here the different partyers are saying thank you for different amounts of time.

236866628,PicoBoard Lab,"My self-authored Getting Unstuck Unstuck Day 21 Provocation:

What academic subject(s) or domain(s) are/were confusing or difficult for you in school? Make a Scratch project to explore that/those topic(s). Afterwards, reflect on what you knew, and what you now know and do not know. Did your exploration through Scratch change your understanding of what you think you know?

//

I chose to make this particular project for two reasons: as a teacher I find the PicoBoard to be a powerful tool used in conjunction with MakeyMakey. MakeyMakey is more reliably supported across different platforms, but relies on binary variables and boolean expressions. PicoBoard introduces, in a physical computing context, non-binary variables as well. I like to focus on that distinction.

I also chose to build this reusable ""laboratory"" for PicoBoards, which can be easily used (via ports C and D) for comparing the conductivity of different household substances, and which therefore bridges a gap from electronics to chemistry.  As a high school student I was very disenfranchised by math and science classes, and dropped out of STEM entirely in 10th grade. So, this project is my working through areas of ignorance and confusion.

I used a PicoBoard with students last week to measure the conductivity of liquids found in our school fridge. Mustard was the most conductive substance - more conductive than water! That sent us toward a chemist for some explanations. The school's scientist was out, so I texted my wife (an erstwhile scientist), who explained that mustard has a lot of vinegar in it, and vinegar has lots of free hydrogen ions.  I (believe that I) know that vinegar is frequently used, because of its chemical stability, in homemade batteries.  As part of our semi-systematic investigation, this was exciting because it led our computing class to chemistry and then to physics. We started with a device I think I know well, the PicoBoard, but ended in wonderful domains that are beyond my understanding.

""Cherish your doubt for doubt is the handmaiden of truth"" -Talmud","Connect a PicoBoard to Scratch and install any needed browser extension. Connect port A to a rotary potentiometer (which will be calibrated 0-50, unlike other sensors which are 0-100), port B to a force resistant sensor.

237359039,Getting Unstuck 21,"When I started teaching computer science a couple of years ago I drew off this Beauty and Joy of Computing lesson (which uses Snap, and offshoot of Scratch): https://bjc.edc.org/Jan2017/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U2/lab-pages/4-abstraction.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-teaching-guide.topic&course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment. 

The assignment asks students to write a program that draws a brick wall, making blocks to draw bricks and rows of bricks.
I modified it to use Scratch instead and used it as a way to introduce the concept of abstraction through the Make a Block tools. 

My prompt for today keeps the original intent of focusing on abstraction but makes it more open by having you create whatever you want by making blocks. 

For my project itself, I wanted to do something that wasn't drawing, so I made a catch-the-thing-while-avoiding-the-other-thing-type game. Creating it with modular blocks was harder than I thought - it was hard to decide which functions of the game needed their own block, and which blocks should control what. I'm also not sure it streamlined my code as much as I thought it would.

237399516,Unstuck 21 Looks effects,"My solution to my prompt - explored the ""change ___ effect"" and ""set ___ effect"" blocks in my ""Jump"" game. This was a very frustrating exercise today, as I found that sometimes the offline version of scratch does not behave the same as the online version. In the offline version, I successfully had the background changing with a transition effect, after each game level. When I uploaded to the online version, nothing worked, and in fact it caused erratic unexplainable behaviours to appear. After hours of troubleshooting I found the cause was any use of the ""change ___ effect"" block on my stage, when it received a broadcast. So sadly that is left out of this posted project, but it works beautifully on my offline version. I put a comment to show where that code should be, in the stage scripts.
Would love someone to explain this to me, if they can!

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE STORY

Choose Your Own Adventure is a series of children's gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome.

The stories are formatted so that, after a couple of pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings.

Use the Events blocks (broadcast, when backdrop switches, etc.) to code a project that lets the viewer choose the outcomes of the story.

You have the power to rotate a small planet!

Unfortunately you have two problems: 
1) Some ugly aliens have invaded your planet
2) Your little planet is bombed by some asteroids

Rotate the planet (use Left and Right arrows to decide verse and velocity of the rotation) to make the asteroid hit the aliens and not the trees and the mountains of your beautiful little world.

* Note that the asteroid can hit an item only when it is close to the planet (i.e. on the opposite side of the planet respect the point it came from).

* Note that the asteroid can hit an item only when it is close to the planet (i.e. on the opposite side of the planet respect the point it came from).
* You earn 2 points if the asteroid hits an alien

For years I have been fascinated by Rube Goldberg creations. While considering how to get inspiration for this project I asked myself a series of questions like, ""In what ways are levels in video games similar to parts of a RG machine b/c the path to a goal may be convoluted with many obstacles to conquer.?"" I know that Rube never meant for there to be physical interpretations of his ideas b/c his cartoons were a social commentary about the industrial revolution. This makes me wonder about how a Scratch project may be used to provoke conversation. For now, I'm just playing with my ""how can I make weird things happen"" fascination!
When I was working with the clone part I got stuck. Everything was working, and then it was not. I was mystified. I finally learned that I had reached the limit of cloning (301 clones) b/c I had not been deleting them as I tested my code. When I clicked on ""stop all"", everything was better!
