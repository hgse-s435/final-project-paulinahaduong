235761629,Scratch-808 Drum Machine,"Reflection

I decided to build a drum machine. I built one in Scratch many years ago, but there was some issues with the timing of sample playback. So I decided to use today's topic as a reason to rebuild it from scratch. While the tempo is still a little janky, it's a major improvement over the original. I'm also hopeful this will run better in Scratch 3, as my experience with it indicates that it is far more strongly timed than Scratch 2.

To make this project work, I make extensive use of variables and cloning.

If I were to spend more time on this, I would use samples from a real Roland-808. The presentation could be improved on. I could also organize this better by placing duplicated code into custom blocks.

Update: Refactored the code which increases the performance of the drum machine. Instead of having 5 step button sprites for each row, only 1 step button is used to spawn all 80.

Originally, each of the 80 step buttons we're responsible for responding to triggers. Hence, 80 if blocks were being run per trigger. Now the trigger logic has been moved into a single sprite, so now only 5 triggers / conditional blocks are used.

The result is a more strongly-timed drum machine. That is, it's less janky.

Update 2: Found a way to improve timing. Inside the clock sprite I created the ""update step"" block and enable ""Run without screen refresh"". Then I moved over the code from the ""When I receive  trigger"".","1) Press the Play button to start.
2) Control the tempo with the slider.

It was a lot of fun exploring some of the limits of music generation with Scratch. If I had more time, I would transcribe more of the epic soundtrack. But I think my simple music player might quickly be overwhelmed by more simultaneous notes or more complex rhythms.

I was wondering how to play an easy song or an effect from my favourite video game soundtracks. I realized that it was very difficult, so I decided to make a sound effect from the ""Legend Of Zelda: A Link to the past"" when you get a treasure.

--Questions--:
-What did you like most about your project? 
I love the idea to use the webcam to create a more interactive game and the choice of making an easy sound effect with a different instrument.

-What would you do with it next, if you had more time?
I'd like to make more musical effects.

Definitely this is my weak side. I'm a terrible musician so I just experimented with changing notes randomly. What I would change in my project is to at least simulate in simple notes the real music you can hear at the end :D

My daughter helped out (and practiced her music reading skills) by reading off the notes to me while I coded them.  When we finished, we experimented with the instruments and adjusted the tempo.  Not bad for our first attempt with creating harmony.  In the future we'll play around with changing the tempo at the end and adjusting the volume level of each voice.
