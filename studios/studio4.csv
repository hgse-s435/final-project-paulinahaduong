235825255,Froggo in Wonderland: Getting Unstuck Day 4 Size,"Getting Unstuck Day 4 Costumes

Creativity:
Changing a Sprite's appearance reminded me of an Alice in Wonderland scenario, where she grows bigger or smaller based on what she eats. My froggo friend is Alice, but I also wanted to play with another character changing costumes, as well as changing the background in response to events in the script.

Production:
Used a lot of ""broadcast message"" blocks to coordinate the activity between all the different sprites. I also realized that if I wanted to run two parallel sequences (like talking and moving) that I could create two scripts that each start with the same event (green flag, or message) and that they would run at the same time. No more fiddling around with wait blocks.

Getting Unstuck:
I was stuck in one area, where I wanted a script to repeat until a specific message is broadcast. You can start a script with a message but you can't end a loop with a message. So I had to Google for some help and found a workaround where you set a variable to 1 with the message and then set the loop to run until the variable = 1.
I'm still unclear about how some events are timed in Scratch, such as what happens when you have a ""wait"" block versus the ""say"" block or the ""play sound"" block, each of which has a certain duration, but what happens to the rest of the script during this time?",Just press the green flag!,3485356,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235825255_480x360.png,2018-07-08T14:37:55.000Z,2018-07-08T15:52:04.000Z,2018-07-08T15:44:11.000Z,8,3,0,0,0,,

* having the planets resize via the ""b"" key but also ""snap"" back to normal automatically while also ""falling"" and changing location with each pass. 


","This is a two player game meant for connecting to Makey Makey. 

The  idea is that Player 1 (the rocket) can only move side-to-side (like in Galaga) while Player 2 controls the size of the planets as they scroll down the screen. 

The object of the game is for Player 1 to dodge the planets by pressing the left arrow/right arrow keys,  while Player 2 can scale the  planet 1 with the up arrow and planet 2 with the down arrow. 

Players could make custom, 2 button space themed controllers that would trigger the keyboard keys.

Things to add: more objects for the rocket to avoid and a system to keep score and one to change players.

I chose a different sprite here because I often just stick with Scratch.
The biggest decision I had with this project was with how to respond to key presses.
Years ago, I started off (with 1.4) using the hat blocks for a game
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2757068/#player
 but someone suggested that I use a loop. I tried it and it was smoother.
However for this project I found the hat blocks worked better. Compare with https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/235910619/","Click the green flag to start or to reset the graphical effects.
These keys change something on the sprite
e - changes the ear colour
c - changes the costume (choose from 1, 2, 3, or 4
t - changes the transparency until Nano becomes invisible!
w - changes the whirl effect ( I've loved this since Scratch 1.4!)

My goal was to keep the project similar to the original while tweaking it to let the user have multiple tries at evolving. I faced many challenges...and persevered! Getting unstuck --> try and fail, and try again! 
First, I needed to understand the sequence of broadcast blocks. I numbered them with comments. I eliminated one broadcast block, & renumbered the rest. 
In order to make the theme music stop playing, I made a variable and triggered it to change. The theme music plays in a ""repeat until"" loop. 
To make the victory music stop, I finally found a simple solution: a wait block followed by a stop all command.
I eliminated the evolve music from the original project b/c it didn't work well with the user choice to repeatedly select different evolutions.
