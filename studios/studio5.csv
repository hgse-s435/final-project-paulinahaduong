My first foray into aligning sound and (admittedly bare) animation was an exciting challenge. I needed to use a BUNCH of Getting Unstuck strategies to get to this point (and I could continue tweaking this for much longer...) Some that I used throughout the day were:

- Fail A LOT
(glitches and other weird, unexpected responses can be very fun to discover, and sometimes bring something even more exciting!)

- Take A Break

- A Stack at a Time 
(you'll see that I abandoned many dancing stacks in this process -- part because it was getting hypnotizing, part isolating bugs)

- Break It Down 
(this was especially helpful when I wrote out the cues for who was singing and dancing when, which would ultimately lead to the broadcasts)

- Answer Someone's Question 
(very helpful as a fairly new scratcher to have reminders that there are plenty of things I do know, and that I can ask questions to figure out that which I don't)

- Be Inspired By Others  
(all of the Getting Unstuck projects are inspiring me so much!!)

- Help a Friend

- Talk it Through

- and JUST KEEP GOING

Ok, I figured it out. Removed the unneeded 4 way movement with arrows, added in a point system, and included a way to win. It makes much more sense now. 

****Orginial
I  really wanted to make my cat move, but I had a lot of trouble figuring out how. I tried to  implement a similar block of code that I used when testing out the Moonhack activity for Scratch, the one that governs the lunar landar, but I couldn't get it work the way I wanted. I then realized that what I wanted Scratch to do was more akin to Flappy Bird, so I looked for an example of that in Scratch. The first result was almost a pixel for pixel reproduction and I couldn't understand the code, so I searched for something simpler and found a block of easier to understand code from a @gotrhythm and that seems to be working for me now. I expect to have the flying ball as something Scratch avoids, or maybe catches. Haven't figured that out yet. It still needs to be fixed so I don't get a ball explosion when Scratch causes the cloning to start. ","Use the space bar to ""fly""

235902074,Space Nyan: Getting Unstuck Day 5 Jumpin n Flyin,"Getting Unstuck Day 5 project, jumping and flying

Creativity: 
I wanted to use a gif, as I learned how from another scratcher recently to import a gif to make an animated sprite. I also wanted to make more of a game-type project, with a score and a clear end-point. Often, the sprites I use depend on what I can find through Google Image Search :-/ So, NyanCat flies through space!

Production:
Lots of sprites, each with animation. It was fun and easy to make a sprite blink quickly between two or three costumes to give them more interest. Getting the objects flying through space at an appropriate speed and spaced out enough was also difficult. I feel I could still improve that aspect of the game.
In addition, I did manage to make NyanCat react every time it got hit, but I wasn't quite sure how to use the ""Touching sprite"" sensor in such a way as to only react once, rather than continuously as the two sprites passed over each other. I ended up putting ""Wait"" blocks in my ""If touching"" blocks, but as always, I wonder if there isn't a more elegant way of doing this.

Getting Unstuck:
So I've realized that I always think there is a more elegant way of doing things... but I rarely go look for it or ask for help. I do like to try to figure things out on my own. I have been using the ""help"" commands more often. Part of it is that I'm not sure how to find the specific information that I'm looking for. 
Another scratcher recently remixed one of my projects and indicated another way of doing something (waiting for keyboard input), so I've made sure to reuse that new strategy in this project.","Click the green arrow, then follow the onscreen instructions.",3485356,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235902074_480x360.png,2018-07-09T14:10:45.000Z,2018-07-09T15:58:29.000Z,2018-07-09T15:34:47.000Z,9,1,1,0,0,,

236152395,Jumping Music,"I shared a slightly different version on my test account! I was thinking about it and thought it would be interesting if the jumping things were music notes that hit the notes at their peak. 

I find this really mesmerizing to play with with big number of notes. 

Update: Just added chord changes after being inspired by @jsh's project Drops.

===Notes from the original===
I wanted to make something for the Getting Unstuck prompt about jumping (but ultimately also incorporated music and randomness). I didn't know exactly what I wanted it to be like, but I thought it would be fun to have lots of interactive things jumping. So I started with some clones and went from there. 

While making this, I experimented with different ways to make a smooth jumping effect. At first, I was doing it the ""math"" way, with a parabolic equation. But I found that confusing in terms of getting the effect that I wanted, and I knew that the code would be big and hard to look at! So I switched to the ""physics"" way, by having a y velocity that I constantly changed with gravity, and repeatedly changing the y position.

Of course, either would work (and they're very related) but the ""physics"" version felt more like I was using the affordances of Scratch and was easier for me to think about, so I stuck with that.

I also added ""play note"" sounds. I experimented with different scales, using lists, and ultimately landed on Bb blues.

A lot of project in scratch use a side view of a flying character.
It was time to a switch of perspective. To render the fligth I tried to leverage on the shadow of the glider. 

When you are higher the shadow is bigger and lighter, as you approach the soil it get darker and shrink.

I'd liked to refine the shadow behaviour but the core concept is here. Time to accept a compromise and pass on the next project of the Getting Unstuck Challenge.

I chose two animals that fly, knowing that I could change their costumes to create a flying animation.  I also knew that I wanted them to bounce, instead of flying off the screen.  It took me a few attempts to get them to flap their wings slower and I had to adjust so that they wouldn't flip upside down after bouncing.  Then I added the ghost and made him ""jump"" up and then return down.  This is my second challenge that I could figure out on my own.  It just took a little experimenting with the motion blocks.","Click on the green flag to see the bats fly across the screen.
