235952041,DIY Poketown,"I had originally though to recreate a more complex town and built out the background using Adobe Illustrator, but once I realized how complicated the code would be (so that buildings didn't land on streets), I pared it down. Reused what I learned about sprites walking in yesterday's project for today's. Only some of the buildings move around, and they mostly don't land on each other or on the street, but it's still a little buggy. 

Got lots of help from the Scratch Forum for figuring out how to stop one sound and turn another one on!

236001609,Getting Unstuck: Day 6 — Snow,"Reflection

I learned something new about the random block: It can output integers or floating point numbers. For example, this will select a whole number from 1 through 10:

(pick random (1) to (10))

If a decimal values are used as parameters then a decimal value is returned. For example, the following will produce a number between 0.0 and 1.0:

(pick random (0.0) to (1.0))

However, I also just learned that decimal numbers with a .0 are truncated to whole numbers when the projected is loaded back up. So there's a bug in Scratch. To get around this, instead of using -1.0 and 1.0 for the jitter, I set the value range to -1.1 and 1.1, which keeps the values from truncating. I also used 4.9 and 16.1 for generating the size of the snowflakes.

More on the random block at the wiki:
https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Pick_Random_()_to_()_(block)

When I read ""random"" I immediately thought of the Monty Hall problem for some reason (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) . 

The use of random is limited to randomly selecting an initial door and then randomly selecting one of the two remaining non-winning doors if the initial selection is the winner.

So while random isn't use much I really liked the idea and it took me into some new territory e.g.:
- using ""define"" to build a block to reset on first clicking the flag and clicking a ""try again"" option.
- using messages to make actions on one sprite affect others.

We have balls of eleven different colors: white, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, green, blue, brown, black, grey.

The game has two level, on the first level the urn is composed of 5 to 9 balls, in the second level there are 10-15 balls.

Your task is to guess what’s inside the urn by counting the occurrence of colors in the extractions. Note that extractions are nondestructive, i.e. once extracted a ball is reintroduced in the urn.

For example, 300 extractions from an urn (containing: 3 red balls, 1 black, 1 yellow, and 1 purple) might result in: 150 red, 56 black, 47 yellow, 47 purple. To guess the colors in the urn the player ought to construct the following list [red, red, red, black, yellow, purple].

Experimenting with random generators might be fun if you can automatize the extractions and the process of counting what has been extracted. 
","Start by extracting (click the ""Extract"" button), than click ""Count"".

This one was a little ambitious. I chose to make a Guess Who game where both the player and the Scratch cat choose a face, then ask & answer questions to narrow down the choices until they can guess which face the other chose. The randomness is incorporated in two places: which face the Scratch Cat chooses and the order in which the questions are asked.

It's a work-in-progress. Right now the cat asks the questions, but the way he does it doesn't quite work. There should be 5 questions total, enough to narrow down the choices to 1, and he should ask different questions until that happens. Unfortunately he asks the same questions multiple times, and he doesn't ask all the questions. I could have him ask them in the same order every time, but that would make the playing field uneven - depending on which face was chosen, either the cat or the player would have an advantage, and if you knew which face to pick you could win every time (unless the cat picked the same face). 

I'm sharing as a draft because, well, I have to go make dinner now. But I'll try to fix it later.

UPDATE: I fixed the question issue, so it asks each question once. The code I had to do that was mostly fine, but the block that reset the counting variable used to iterate over the list was in the wrong place.

New issue: it's not eliminating the correct faces in response to the player's answers to the questions. I think this is, again, a list-related problem. I'm currently running the program with the faces list displayed to see what's going on.

Again, the code to reset the counting variable was in the wrong place. I fixed that, but it's still not eliminating the right faces.

UPDATE 2: IT WORKS!! I used this project from ListWizard: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11260012/#editor to see an example of how to delete items from a list. I needed to change the variable that iterates through the list by -1 after deleting the item. I think I get why, since the length of the list has now changed, but I'm not 100% percent sure why it works.

Creativity:
I had already used random variables (by chance) in yesterday's project, so I wanted to go a bit further in my exploration of HOW random variables can influence a project. To fully grasp the effect of randomness, you need a large sample size... so I made sure to have lots of clones of a sprite, each random in some way.

Production:
I decided to test changing three different variables for a single sprite. There is also the question of HOW the randomness affects those variables. So, I ended up having 9 different conditions, so that's 9 nested ""if-then"" loops. I was helped by a fellow Scratcher's observations that variables can be different for each clone of a sprite, so I didn't have to figure out how to duplicate a whole bunch of variables 165 times (or more!).

Getting Unstuck:
I actually got ""pre-unstuck"" by thinking about what I wanted to achieve and then looking through some similar projects before getting started. Because I knew what I wanted to do, I was able to hone in on strategies that I felt would be useful for my project.
I did want to go further, by examining how to apply the random effects to each element in the grid, or the same random effect to all of the elements at once, or to some subset of the grid, for example, row-by-row. However, that would have meant at least three more conditions to test, for at least 27 overall... Ooof! Maybe another time.

236081410,Random Story Inspirator,"The inspiration for this project comes from a wonderful book that I've been recently re-reading called ""The Grammar of Fantasy - An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories"" by Italian writer and pedagogist Gianni Rodari. In his book, Rodari talks about the ""fantastic binomial"": the more two objects are unrelated or conceptually distant, the more potential is there to invent a story.

So I decided to make a random ""fantastic binomial generator"", to help people invent stories with Scratch. I was surprised to see how many stories came to my mind by trying this simple project! I hope it can help other people come up with fantastic stories!

I've been also tinkering with different ""prompts"". At the end I landed on ""Wait, what?"" that I've found both universal and generative. That also comes from a book, it's called ""Wait, what?"" by James Ryan.

217872616,Almondrian - Getting Unstuck day 6,"I usually use the random block at least once in every project, at least the biggest ones, so the exercise would be of little use for me. I had to find something new to learn or experiment with. Since I think the Scratch turtle miss a fill block, I took the chance to create a procedure that emulate it. 

The perpendicular lines are drawn at random positions. Also the cells to fill with color are chosen in the same way.

What I would have do with more time
===========================
I would have traced better the lines, with some thicker and layered an algorithm for drawing with a more realistic simulation.
Actually the drawing are similar (read I utterly copied it) to https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mondrian-composition-with-yellow-blue-and-red-t00648

The most difficult thing
=================
The real hurdle of this project was laying the lines. A really random choose does not do the trick as the lines appear too near each other, or the canvas is not used in his entirety. What I've done is to split the stage into columns (and rows) and tuning them with random adjustment to imitate the  feeling of a Mondrian composition.
The result is quite satisfactory to me.

I had previously made a multiplication project (with the help of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkewBLjexd0 ), so this time I decided to make an addition project using two random number variables. At first I used the same random number variable for both numbers in the addition problem (kept getting 2+2, 5+5, 10+10, etc.). Took me a second to realize I needed two different random number variables..oops!",Click on the sprite to practice simple addition. ,22105327,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236557299_480x360.png,2018-07-16T18:03:08.000Z,2018-07-16T18:34:23.000Z,2018-07-16T18:34:23.000Z,5,0,0,0,0,,

237139830,Snakes and Ladders 2018,"I've been working on this 'on and off' for quite a long time, but 'Get Unstuck' got me motivated enough to get it finished!! As several contributors did, I started with some dice - inspired by an OLD Commodore 64 game (Monopole), but I took it a step further and integrated the dice into a full game. I think there's a lot of learning in translating the rules of a board game into a working computer programme.

NB - it's not guaranteed to be bug-free ! :-)

The game 'board' is from https://www.everypixel.com/image-4479851198415772260; I'm sure I've borrowed some code or inspiration from other sources along the way but can't currently remember where. I know https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/744/#editor was a useful place to start but my project has mutated quite a bit since I first started, so I don't think it qualifies as a re-mix.

I'm sure there are more efficient ways to do some of this and I'd love to see if anyone can optimise it. I'd love to adapt as much of this project as possible to other classic board games and I'm open to collaboration!","Instructions are included but click the green flag to run, then press space to start the game.
