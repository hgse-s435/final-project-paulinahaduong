236056530,HexaPaths remix,"Remixed from @technoboy10 - this was a bit challenging because I definitely tried to overcomplicate the math involved! Also I often struggle with remixes because sometimes I find it really difficult to really understand someone else's code, and then to make a meaningful change to it...that can definitely be hard. Originally I had thought I might try my hand at some fractals and recursive trees, but that will have to wait for a day that is less busy. 

I learned that if a sprite is covering the slider variables, you can't touch the slider variable (I thought the sliders were always on the top layer, but I guess I'm wrong), and I also found that the way transparency/ghosting was handled in this project to be fairly clever (It's a second sprite layer with a white background).

As I chatted with @mizzpeters and @asparklekat about feeling stuck, @mizzpeters asked me what I was excited about and @asparklekat suggested tinkering. I ended up mashing both of these pieces of advice together to produce this project for Day 7 of Getting Unstuck.

I started out wanting to make a program that printed graph paper. (I'm OBSESSED with graph paper.) After I had programmed the basic grid making, I went back to the Pen category to see what I might tinker around with. That led me to play with the Pen color and the Pen size blocks. The Pen size block really blew the program open for me in terms of creative inspiration and engagement! I abandoned the horizontal line drawing (although the code is still in there), and just kept the vertical line drawing. Tinkering with these streaks of rainbows by varying the grid size feels very engaging and satisfying to me.

Admittedly, my main excitement here was the time-based celebration and not necessarily a celebration of pen-patterns.

I'd like for questions like ""Why a pattern with this concept?"" and then ""How will I create a pattern?"" to be more considered in my process of this project. I'd like to imagine the patterns I'd like to draw and then think of what would be necessary to draw them (or find something more surprising that I also enjoy!)

by Massimo Marletta

In this project I use Pen blocks to draw straight lines according to a mathematical rule. Despite the fact that the lines are all straight, the overall figure seems curved as an equilateral hyperbola is formed.

To make more readable the code I used a custom block that perform the drawing of a single line given the coordinates of the two ends.

The drawing is made by a Sprite (which is hidden). The click on the Stage is notified to the Sprite by means of a broadcast message.

236148611,Getting Unstuck 7,"I wanted to incorporate my love of knitting into at least one of these challenges! I programmed the pen to draw the knit stitches stitch by stitch and row by row, then I added the knitting needles. I tried to use Make a Block, repeats, and variables to keep the program as efficient as possible.

The only trouble I had was in getting the needles to be empty of stitches on the first row, then to have stitches on each subsequent row. I ended up creating a variable to keep track of whether it was the first row or not and use that to determine which costumes the needles were showing.

The program is also kind of slow (or maybe meditative? Perhaps I should add some soothing music...(UPDATE: Music added!)). I could adjust the speed on the stitches' turns by doing fewer repeats with a sharper turning angle, but this would also change the shape of the stitches and I kind of like them the way they are.
