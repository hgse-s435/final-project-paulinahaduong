236143037,Getting Unstuck Day 8: Fish Chomp remix,"Seagull and clams from Creative Commons image search.

The Day 8 challenge reminded me of a student activity page in the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide (http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/) and I wanted to see how it might feel for a student to go through the activity on their own.

I changed the way the user manipulates the big fish (I thought it was awkward to use the mouse from a laptop), and added two new levels. I was trying to recreate a game that I loved when I was little (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZUXImHsEIQ) for level 3.

There are still some buggy things (such as the creepy kind-of-dead-looking seagull), and I hope to come back to this project later to smooth them out!","Guide the big fish with the arrow keys to eat the little fish. See how many little fish you can catch!

I had SO MUCH FUN making this. I was walking down the street with @jsh, when we saw a huge pile of abandoned mussels on the side of the road. I asked @jsh what they were and he said, ""I don't really know my mollusks!"" And thus a project was born!

I used counting in two ways in this project: to determine when the player has reached the target of 10 mollusks, and then to report out the count for each of the 3 types of mollusks at the end (if you win).

I searched for ""harp music"" on Scratch and found @lkaufm's ""Irish Harp Interactive"": https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/53006916/

This is my first game (and my first time using clones!) and it was so much fun to make!

After starting on a few different ideas, I landed on creating a concentric circle generator that accepts input from the user via the slider. 

The process is simple. It stamps a circle, changes costume, reduces size, and repeats a number of times specified by the slider.

The number of circles that are drawn is stored in the nCircles variable. The slider feature of this variable enabled. Instead of drawing the concentric circles every frame, the script instead responds to when the value of nCircle changes. There's a note in the script that points to where this happens.

One feature that could be added is moving the center point of a stamped circle each iteration to generate images similar to Marcel Duchamp's AnÃ©mic CinÃ©ma rotoreliefs.",Use the slider to change the number of concentric circles.,26264460,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/235823446_480x360.png,2018-07-08T13:54:43.000Z,2018-07-12T17:01:20.000Z,2018-07-12T13:29:10.000Z,29,9,1,0,0,,

236217767,Just a little bit,"
Getting Unstuck day-8
by Massimo Marletta

In this project I explain how counting is done in binary numbers.

For the ""bit"" I used a Sprite with 2 costumes (0 and 1). This Sprite has several local variables (its properties), such as its value (0 or 1), its position (0=least significative bit, 1=second signitificative bit, etc).

The Green Button increase the first bit, when a bit pass from 1 to 0 (overflow) it set the variable Destination to its Position+1 and send a broadcast message to all the sprites yelling ""overflow!"".
The bit that have the Position corresponding to the Destination (i.e. the bit at the left of the bit that raised the overflow) is then incremented and (if necessary) it can raise the overflow again...
So the global variable Destination is used to select which bit must respond to the broadcast message.

The number of bits is not fixed from the beginning (you start with just  1 bit). If a further bit is needed it is created by cloning the one who is about to raise the overflow.
A Lightening represent the overflow which propagates through the bits.
The global variable Count (showed at screen) counts in decimal number.
","*** Do you know how to count in binary?
*** Press the Green Button to increase the binary number shown!

At the beginning you have just a single bit 0, when you press the button it becomes 1, when you press the button again it cannon grow again (in binary the only symbols allowed are 0 and 1) and therefore it get back to 0 raising an Overflow (represented by the Lightening) to the bit at its left. If such a bit does not exist, it is created... so you can count from 0 to +Infinite in binary numbers!",4804940,https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/236217767_480x360.png,2018-07-12T12:48:59.000Z,2018-07-12T15:33:31.000Z,2018-07-12T14:33:04.000Z,23,7,1,0,0,,

235417125,savetheclocktower,"for Day 8 of GettingUnstuck, I'm tinkering a bit more with this project in preparation for a physical computing camp next week.

The speed of the vehicle in MPH is calculated at the second circuit point and published on screen. As a math dropout I'm always unsure of my calculations so I would appreciate feedback on these.

If the calculated speed is between 8 and 9 mph (a nod to the 88 mph benchmark established in Back to the Future), the background changes briefly.

PROBLEMS: 1) this calculates the average speed over a stretch of track, but is it possible to calculate speed at a specific location? One can shorten the gap between circuits but the conceptual problem remains. 2) Is there a threshold amount of time needed for makeymakey to recognize that a circuit has been completed? 3) Passing through the circuits slows the vehicle down, based on how I've engineered the wires. Is there a better way to engineer this so the vehicle isn't slowed down? 4) Can the program be improved, possibly by adding another circuit to the course, so that the slowdown at each circuit point is calculated, and the speed at the final circuit is suitably discounted? 5) Scratch's moonwalking isn't very good.","v. 1 the beginning of a physical computing project to measure the speed of a matchbox car at a given point in space

I wanted to stretch my comfort level, especially since this project deals with variables. I've used variables for scoring, but not much else. I liked this idea because in addition to score it uses variables to set the speed and angle of the penguin. At first the game was too easy. All you had to do was point at the iceberg. I had to play around and tweak the speed and gap to get the penguin to launch at the angle I wanted.

I figured out how to add lives when a certain score is reached, but I'd like to be able to add a life at certain increments, for example at every multiple of 50.

But I am convinced of the remix spirit. I was able to do more remixing this video in half an hour than I would have been able to do on my own.

When the score is greater than 10, then the ball moves faster. After 20 and 30 it also gets faster.  Each time the ball goes behind the cat, the score decreases by 1.  When the score is less than 1, the game is over.
Some modifications we plan to make include: 
-When the speed changes, the ball switched colors (changes costume)
-When the ball goes behind the cat, the score changes by -5, making the game a bit more challenging.
-Once the ball gets faster, it doesn't slow down (still haven't figured out how to do this - any suggestions?  I'm thinking maybe using If, then, else or set a range such as score > 10 and score <20)

""create a project that counts the number of times something happensâand responds when the count reaches a certain number""
This project has definitely evolved -- it began with walking around a circle, but with random turns -- checking the total until it reached or exceeded 360, then adjusting so that the final turn made the total 360. Thinking about turtle art and mathematical stitching, after a number of variations (from dots to colored lines), the randomly generated points of the turns are stored in lists, then the lists are stepped through to create the lines from the first point of each original path. The color changes for each design; shading changes step by step until the ""floor"" of the distance to the point is reached. (Hopefully this will make more sense if you happen to look at the code.)","0. Green Flag = clear
