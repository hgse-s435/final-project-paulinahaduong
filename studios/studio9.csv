So, this is a simple project, but it forced me to learn a little more about how to implement sine functions in Scratch, explore RGB color range, and also use the sensing color block!

I was using the original, full-color Starry Night and it was wayyyy too many colors to try to detect. I was feeling a bit demoralized and thought about abandoning the project entirely. And then I thought, ""If I can't make the code easier (detecting these millions and millions of colors), could I make something _else_ easier?"" And that's when I had the insight to make the image ""easier"" by reducing the number of unique colors in the image. (I found Van Gogh's Starry Night on Google's Art and Culture, took a screen capture of it, then reduced the number of colors in Photoshop.) Of course, it doesn't look as beautiful or as vivid as the original—but I think you can still tell that it's Starry Night. I'm excited about this prototype. :)","My friend Dock is color blind.

This was fun as it came together! The part I got stuck on was the prize sprite wasn't changing to the right color costume each time. It turned out both the arrow sprite and the prize sprite were doing something in triggered by receiving the prize broadcast and since the prize sprite conditions depended on a variable set by the arrow I had to add a slight delay to the prize sprite so the variable would have time to be set by the arrow.

236245174,Getting Unstuck: Day 9 — Generative Art,"Reflection

I wanted to improve on my Day 7 project in which multiple cloned pens draw sine waves to the screen. Instead of using dumb agents (that's the technical term) I integrated the color touch block so that the pens can respond to their environment.

The idea is simple, randomly pick a place to start a pair of smart agents, randomly choose a direction for the first agent and a user-defined offset (controlled by the slider) for the second, and let them move until they detect black, at which point they stop.

Overall, it works pretty well. However, one issue is the color touching block looks specifically for black. Because of anti-aliasing drawn lines, some of the pixels are dark grey and don't register with the color sensing block. I could complain, but I think the generated compositions look better because of this glitchiness.

I really struggled with this and never got it to do what I wanted. The second I read the challenge I knew I wanted to make a chameleon. I can't draw well enough for that, so switched to a butterfly.
I fought with the color changing for almost an hour and a half! I WANT to be able to create a variable that senses color and then changes the sprite to match that color. I could not figure out how to do that. I tried to create a block that would recognize color, but no. I then fell back on ""if touching color x"" ""set color to x"". Looking up all the color values. That doesn't work - FYI - I still don't really know why.
I then simplified my background to only 4 (sorry about how lurid) colors and learned that the value you set in color is altered by the color at which your sprite starts! When it was white, the color change was so infinitesimal I couldn't really see it! Okay, turned it to a nice vibrant purple and then one color at a time experimented with numbers until they shifted to a reasonable approximation of the desired color.
Thanks to MrQuentin for bearing with the increasingly unhinged ranting that accompanied today's project and figuring out that part about the original color of the sprite affecting the color changes!

I've been spending more than 2 hours on a different project (inspired by the painting ""Clear Ideas"") but couldn't get anything good from it. I thought it was a great opportunity to check out again the ""getting unstuck tip"" on the website. 

I tried ""Just Keep Going"" for a while, but I was feeling more and more frustrated. I was inspired by the ""Problem? Opportunity!"" but still didn't know how to apply that to my super stuck situation.. Finally reading the ""Try Something Different"" gave me the courage and confidence to put all my previous work aside and start with a completely new project, and this time I tried to keep it as simple as I could.

I started with a simple painting of the sky, decided to add only one object, and focus on finding a way to use color sensing. I experienced the same problem of @karenb with the painting having many different colors. Then I realized that the different shades of gray of the clouds could become an opportunity to add a bit of randomness.. so the umbrella get stuck only when their handle touches a specific color.

Now it's 2:25am, and I'm exhausted, and joyful, and proud.

237400261,Getting Unstuck - Day 9 : My 2nd attempt!,"Okay, the journey to this project was two-fold.  I started by making a basic animation of the cat jumping on the beach background.  When he was touching the color of the sand he would jump and say that it was too hot, then return back to the sand and continue in a loop.  It was very basic, but it completed the challenge of the day.  I knew that I would have preferred to make my own background, like it was suggested in the email, but had never tried it before. 

Then I went to the library with my daughter and discovered the book, ""Code Your Own Games"" by Max Wainewright and one of the games was the 'Amazing Maze'.  So I had a lot of ""help"" with this one!  I would suggest drawing out your maze first.  I would also like to figure out how to make the cat bounce off the walls or edges if possible, or add an animation for completing the maze successfully.","Click the green arrow to start the maze.
